bibTOhtml is a small perl script that takes a BibTeX file as input and
outputs a set of HTML pages. See our publication pages for an example
of output.

We had negative 10 minutes to write this script, so it comes with no
real interface, documentation, or anything. The definitions which you
can change to customize it to your needs are all at the top of the
perl code, which should make it easy to edit.
