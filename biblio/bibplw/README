Add.html and edit.html are just minimal pages used to input values to the perl script
edit_entry.pl.  Add.html does not need to be modified much, but edit.html should be
replaced by a Browse Existing Publications page, or a Search Results page.

Bibstyle.css is the stylesheet used.  I just appended the types TD.req, TD.exact,
TD.atlst, TD.opt, and TD.atmst to the style.css file already used for formatting the
iLab publication pages.

Edit_entry.pl can do one of two things.  It can take the Paper ID of an existing publication
and output all of its information, in fields which can be modified.  Or it can take a
publication type and output empty fields which can be modified.
There are 3 scenarios it may face:
1) Add New passes it a known type
   Result: Print a blank form of the given type
2) Edit passes it an existing Paper ID
   and the type associated with that ID is known
   Result: Print a form of the given type with default values
3) Edit passes it an existing Paper ID
   but the type associated with that ID is unknown
   Result: Print a generic form using "@fieldlist" and default values
Note that Add New should never pass an unknown type because the user must choose the type
from a pull-down menu, and that Add New does not pass a paper ID.
Also, Edit should never pass an unknown paper ID because the user must pick the paper to
edit from the ones that already exist, on the Search Results page.

Modify_entry.pl is called by edit_entry.pl to save the changes that are made.  Right now
modify_entry.pl does nothing.  It only contains a pseduo code outline for what the script
is required to do.

Sample.bib is the sample bibtex file used to test these scripts.  It contains about 10
entries.  The paper ID's are all the even numbers from 2 to 18.  All of them are actually
articles, but #4 has type "FakeType" and #6 has type "Phdthesis" to fully test the scripts.

Blank.bib is used by edit_entry.pl when we are adding a new entry.  All it needs to contain
is "@type", and "type" doesn't even have to be a valid BibTex type.

To do list:
- code for modify_entry.pl
- html page and perl script for searching the bibtex file 
- html page and perl script for browsing through the search results
- format the pages to look like the rest of the iLab webpages (add banner at top, etc)
