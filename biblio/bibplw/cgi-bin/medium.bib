abstract            = { A motion sequence may be represented as a single pattern
                        in x-y-t space; a velocity of motion corresponds to a three-dimensional
                        orientation in this space. Motion sinformation can be extracted
                        by a system that responds to the oriented spatiotemporal
                        energy. We discuss a class of models for human motion mechanisms
                        in which the first stage consists of linear filters that
                        are oriented in space-time and tuned in spatial frequency.
                        The outputs of quadrature pairs of such filters are squared
                        and summed to give a measure of motion energy. These responses
                        are then fed into an opponent stage. Energy models can be
                        built from elements that are consistent with known physiology
                        and psychophysics, and they permit a qualitative understanding
                        of a variety of motion phenomena. }

                        aperture, and the light striking a given subregion of the
                        aperture is structured somewhat differently than the light
                        striking an adjacent subregion. By analyzing this optical
                        structure, one can infer the depths of objects in the scene,
                        i.e., one can achieve ''single lens stereo.'' We describe
                        a novel camera for performing this analysis. It incorporates
                        a single main lens along with a lenticular array placed
                        at the sensor plane. The resulting ''plenoptic camera''
                        provides information about how the scene would look when
                        viewed from a continuum of possible viewpoints bounded by
                        the main lens aperture. Deriving depth information is simpler
                        than in a binocular stereo system because the correspondence
                        problem is minimized. The camera extracts information about
                        both horizontal and vertical parallax, which improves the
                        reliability of the depth estimates. },

                        stimuli with specific features such as orientation and spatial
                        frequency. Although the receptive fields of these cells
                        have been thought to be local and independent, recent physiological
                        and psychophysical evidence has accumulated, indicating
                        that the cells participate in a rich network of local connections.
                        Thus, these local processing units can integrate information
                        over much larger parts of the visual field; the pattern
                        of their response to a stimulus apparently depends on the
                        context presented. To explore the pattern of lateral interactions
                        in human visual cortex under different context conditions
                        we used a novel chain lateral masking detection paradigm,
                        in which human observers performed a detection task in the
                        presence of different length chains of high-contrast-flanked
                        Gabor signals. The results indicated a nonmonotonic relation
                        of the detection threshold with the number of flankers.
                        Remote flankers had a stronger effect on target detection
                        when the space between them was filled with other flankers,
                        indicating that the detection threshold is caused by dynamics
                        of large neuronal populations in the neocortex, with a major
                        interplay between excitation and inhibition. We considered
                        a model of the primary visual cortex as a network consisting
                        of excitatory and inhibitory cell populations, with both
                        short- and long-range interactions. The model exhibited
                        a behavior similar to the experimental results throughout
                        a range of parameters. Experimental and modeling results
                        indicated that long-range connections play an important
                        role in visual perception, possibly mediating the effects
                        of context. },

abstract            = { Human ability to identify simultaneously two targets in
                        the visual field is severely limited. Previous studies have
                        shown that orientation identification of two targets takes
                        twice the time needed for one target. Here we asked whether
                        this seriality is imposed by the decision requirement of
                        the task or by such stimulus properties as target spatial
                        separation and similarity. Observers had to identify the
                        orientations (vertical vs horizontal) of two Gabor patches
                        presented at random positions. Performance on this double-task
                        experiment was compared with performance on each of the
                        tasks when carried out alone. We varied the spatial separation
                        between the two targets for targets having identical or
                        different spatial-frequencies and found that the orientation
                        of two targets having different frequencies could be identified
                        in parallel when occupying the same spatial position but
                        not when separated in space by 4 deg of visual angle or
                        more. Targets having the same frequency could be identified
                        in parallel even when separated by 8 deg, demonstrating
                        that decision factors do not impose seriality. This result
                        can be taken as evidence for the existence of a grouping
                        process operating prior to orientation identification. This
                        grouping process operates according to classical Gestalt
                        rules (proximity, similarity) and enables parallel attentive
                        processing of large input chunks. },

                        generation of orientation selectivity in macaque striate
                        cortex. In contrast to previous models, where the initial
                        orientation bias is generated by convergent geniculate input
                        to simple cells and subsequently sharpened by lateral circuits,
                        our approach is based on anisotropic intracortical excitatory
                        connections which provide both the initial orientation bias
                        and its subsequent amplification. Our study shows that the
                        emerging response properties are similar to the response
                        properties that are observed experimentally, hence the hypothesis
                        of an intracortical generation of orientation bias is a
                        sensible alternative to the notion of an afferent bias by
                        convergent geniculocortical projection patterns. In contrast
                        to models based on an afferent orientation bias, however,
                        the ''intracortical hypothesis'' predicts that orientation
                        tuning gradually evolves from an initially nonoriented response
                        and a complete loss of orientation tuning when the recurrent
                        excitation is blocked, but new experiments must be designed
                        to unambiguously decide between both hypotheses. },

                        of this neuronal degeneration was studied quantitatively,
                        and the astroglial response was examined with glial fibrillary
                        acidic protein immunohistochemistry. More than 95% of the
                        neurons in the ipsilateral LGN survive during the first
                        3 days following a lesion of the visual cortex. However,
                        in the next 4 days, massive neuronal death ensues, reducing
                        the number of surviving neurons to approximately 33% of
                        normal by the end of the first postoperative week. Between
                        2 weeks and 24 weeks postoperatively, the number of neurons
                        present in the LGN declines very gradually from 34% to 17%
                        of normal. Three days after a lesion of the visual cortex,
                        the mean cross- sectional areas of ipsilateral LGN neurons
                        are 13% smaller than normal (87%). By 1 week after the operation,
                        surviving LGN neurons have atrophied to 66% of their normal
                        area. Subsequently, the size of surviving neurons declines
                        slowly to approximately 50% of normal at 24 weeks after
                        the cortical lesion. Astrocytes in the ipsilateral LGN also
                        react to cortical damage. At 1 day after a lesion of the
                        visual cortex, glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity
                        in the LGN is almost undetectable, but a distinct increase
                        in immunoreactivity is seen at 3 days. Immunoreactivity
                        peaks between 1 week and 2 weeks postoperatively and, thereafter,
                        remains intense for at least 24 weeks. Thus, following a
                        lesion of the visual cortex, the somata of neurons in the
                        LGN remain essentially normal morphologically for about
                        3 days before the onset of rapid atrophy and death. Moreover,
                        most of the neural cell death that occurs in the LGN after
                        axotomy takes place in the last half of the first postoperative
                        week. },
