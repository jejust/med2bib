abstract={Most models of visual search, whether involving overt eye movements
or covert shifts of attention, are based on the concept of a saliency map, 
that is, an explicit two-dimensional map that encodes the saliency or 
conspicuity of objects in the visual environment. Competition among neurons
in this map gives rise to a single winning location that corresponds to the
next attended target. Inhibiting this location automatically allows the
system to attend to the next most salient location. We describe a detailed
computer implementation of such a scheme, focusing on the problem of
combining information across modalities, here orientation, intensity and
color information, in a purely stimulus-driven manner. The model is applied
to common psychophysical stimuli as well as to a very demanding visual
search task. Its successful performance is used to address the extent to
which the primate visual system carries out visual search via one or more
such saliency maps and how this can be tested.},

abstract={3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), an illicit recreational
drug, damages serotonergic nerve endings. Since the cerebrovasculature is 
4regulated partly by the serotonergic system, MDMA may affect cerebral blood
flow (CBF) in humans. We evaluated 21 abstinent recreational MDMA users and
21 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects with brain SPECT and MRI. Ten
of the MDMA subjects also had repeat SPECT and MRI after receiving two
doses of MDMA. Abstinent MDMA users showed no significantly different
global or regional CBF (rCBF) compared to the control subjects. However,
within 3 weeks after MDMA administration, rCBF remained decreased in the
visual cortex, the caudate, the superior parietal and dorsolateral frontal
regions compared to baseline rCBF. The decreased rCBF tended to be more
pronounced in subjects who received the higher dosage of MDMA. Two subjects
who were scanned at 2-3 months after MDMA administration showed increased
rather than decreased rCBF. Low-dose recreational MDMA use does not cause
detectable persistent rCBF changes in humans. The lack of long-term rCBF
changes may be due to a non-significant effect of serotonergic deficits on
rCBF, or regeneration of serotonergic nerve terminals. The subacute
decrease in rCBF after MDMA administration may be due to the direct effect
of MDMA on the serotonergic system or the indirect effects of its
metabolites on the dopaminergic system; the preliminary data suggest these
effects may be transient.},

abstract={A method is presented for simultaneous correction of linear
geometric distortions and interscan patient motion in echoplanar imaging

other than high-resolution magnetic resonance images. The method is based
on a generalized surface-based coregistration algorithm, which accounts for
a complete 3-dimensional affine transformation, i.e., rotations, 
translations, scaling, and shearing, between two volumetric image data 
sets. Any minimally distorted high-resolution scan may serve as a reference
data set, to which the EPI data set is matched. The algorithmic accuracy
was assessed using simulated data sets with known affine distortions. The
deviation of the parameters determined by the coregistration program from
the true values typically was 1\% or less. Precise alignment of functional
and anatomic information will be important for many future clinical
applications.},

abstract={Two different acquisition and processing strategies to determine
the regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) with magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) are compared. The first method is based on the acquisition of the 
signal time course during a bolus administration of a contrast agent 
(dynamic method). The second method evaluates signal changes before and 
after the contrast agent injection (static method), assuming the contrast 
agent remains primarily intravascular in the brain after the first pass. 
Both methods were applied to the same data sets, acquired with either 
echoplanar imaging (EPI, n = 18) or fast low-angle shot (FLASH, n = 28) 
techniques. A voxel-by-voxel correlation between the static and dynamic 
method yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.76 +/- 0.06 for the EPI and 
0.71 +/- 0.10 for the FLASH measurements. The static method was less 
sensitive and showed higher standard deviations for rCBV than the dynamic 
method. With the development of truly intravascular contrast agents, the 
static perfusion MRI method, which can be performed with higher 
signal-to-noise ratio and higher spatial resolution, may become an 
alternative to ultra-fast MRI for measuring rCBV.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to determine the relationship in
regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as measured with perfusion magnetic
resonance imaging (pMRI) and single photon emission computer tomography
(SPECT). rCBF was determined in 26 healthy subjects with pMRI and SPECT.
After co-registration of pMRI with SPECT, rCBF was determined in 10 brain 
regions relative to the whole slice value. pMRI was evaluated with and 
without elimination of large vessels. rCBF from pMRI correlates 
significantly with rCBF from SPECT (r = 0.69 with and r = 0.59 without 
elimination of large vessels; p \< 0.0001 for both). Elimination of large 
vessels reduced the interindividual variance of the pMRI measurements in 
most regions. rCBF from pMRI shows good correlation with rCBF from SPECT. 
Because pMRI is sensitive to flow in large vessels while SPECT is not, 
elimination of large vessels in pMRI reduces the interindividual 
variability of pMRI and improves the-correlation between the two methods. 
pMRI is a reliable noninvasive method for rCBF measurements.},

abstract={We investigated and contrasted midline cerebral structures in 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). FTD and AD may 
be difficult to distinguish clinically. FTD typically affects frontal and 
anterior temporal regions, whereas AD tends to involve more posterior 
temporal and parietal areas. We hypothesized that disease-specific cerebral
alterations would be differentially reflected in corresponding regions of
the corpus callosum (CC), pericallosal CSF space (PCS), or their ratio
(CC:PCS). Regions-of-interest (ROIs) from midsagittal MRIs in 17 AD, 16
FTD, and 12 elderly control (EC) subjects were analyzed. ROIs were divided
into four regions using an anatomic landmark-based computer algorithm and
were adjusted for head size variation. FTD subjects had a much smaller
anterior CC region and significantly larger PCS area, particularly in
anterior regions. AD and EC subjects did not differ significantly in any
total or regional ROI measure. Total and anterior CC:PCS ratios were
markedly lower in FTD patients. Across groups, total CC:PCS correlated
significantly with midsagittal cerebral area and was similarly associated
with Mini-Mental State Examination score. Anterior CC (AD) and PCS (FTD)
regions exhibited disease-specific relationships to these variables. A
discriminant model using two ROI variables correctly classified 91\% of AD
and FTD patients, comparing favorably with blind clinical MRI diagnostic
ratings. Midline cerebral structural alterations reflect differential
patterns of cerebral degeneration in AD and FTD, yielding morphometric
indices that may facilitate the study of brain-behavior relationships and
differential diagnosis of dementia.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Apathy is a pervasive noncognitive neuropsychiatric 
disturbance in Alzheimer disease, which causes significant caregiver 
distress. The neuroanatomical substrate of apathy is not well understood. 
OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between regional cerebral blood flow 
and the presence and severity of the personality disturbance, apathy, in 
individuals with Alzheimer disease. DESIGN: Analysis of the relationship 
between regional cerebral blood flow as measured by single photon emission 
computed tomography and severity of apathy as measured by the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory using an analysis of variance design. We 
examined regional cerebral perfusion alterations as measured by xenon 
133Xecalibrated technetium Tc 99m hexamethyl-propyleneamine-oxime single 
photon emission computed tomography in relation to the presence and 
severity of apathy. SETTING: The neurology clinics of the University of 
California, Los Angeles, UCLA School of Medicine, and Harbor-UCLA Medical 
Center. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one community-dwelling patients fulfilling 
National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and 
Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association diagnostic 
criteria for probable Alzheimer disease who had a single photon computed 
tomographic scan performed within 3 months of administration of the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory. RESULTS: The presence of apathy was associated 
with more severe prefrontal and anterior temporal dysfunction. These 
regional cerebral perfusion relationships with apathy were independent of 
cognitive decline except in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the association of apathetic 
syndromes with prefrontal and anterior temporal regional brain dysfunction 
and are consistent with similar findings previously reported in other 
disorders.},
