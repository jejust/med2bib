abstract={Most models of visual search, whether involving overt eye movements
or covert shifts of attention, are based on the concept of a saliency map, 
that is, an explicit two-dimensional map that encodes the saliency or 
conspicuity of objects in the visual environment. Competition among neurons
in this map gives rise to a single winning location that corresponds to the
next attended target. Inhibiting this location automatically allows the
system to attend to the next most salient location. We describe a detailed
computer implementation of such a scheme, focusing on the problem of
combining information across modalities, here orientation, intensity and
color information, in a purely stimulus-driven manner. The model is applied
to common psychophysical stimuli as well as to a very demanding visual
search task. Its successful performance is used to address the extent to
which the primate visual system carries out visual search via one or more
such saliency maps and how this can be tested.},

abstract={3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), an illicit recreational
drug, damages serotonergic nerve endings. Since the cerebrovasculature is 
4regulated partly by the serotonergic system, MDMA may affect cerebral blood
flow (CBF) in humans. We evaluated 21 abstinent recreational MDMA users and
21 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects with brain SPECT and MRI. Ten
of the MDMA subjects also had repeat SPECT and MRI after receiving two
doses of MDMA. Abstinent MDMA users showed no significantly different
global or regional CBF (rCBF) compared to the control subjects. However,
within 3 weeks after MDMA administration, rCBF remained decreased in the
visual cortex, the caudate, the superior parietal and dorsolateral frontal
regions compared to baseline rCBF. The decreased rCBF tended to be more
pronounced in subjects who received the higher dosage of MDMA. Two subjects
who were scanned at 2-3 months after MDMA administration showed increased
rather than decreased rCBF. Low-dose recreational MDMA use does not cause
detectable persistent rCBF changes in humans. The lack of long-term rCBF
changes may be due to a non-significant effect of serotonergic deficits on
rCBF, or regeneration of serotonergic nerve terminals. The subacute
decrease in rCBF after MDMA administration may be due to the direct effect
of MDMA on the serotonergic system or the indirect effects of its
metabolites on the dopaminergic system; the preliminary data suggest these
effects may be transient.},
