Converting BibTeX files to PostgreSQL database
(see notes below)

create table master (
key char(30) not null primary key,
entrytype int not null,
author varchar(200) not null,
title varchar(200),
journal char(80),
volume char(10),
number char(10),
pages char(20),
month int,
year int not null,
booktitle char(120),
editor varchar(200),
organization varchar(120),
publisher varchar(120),
address varchar(300),
keywords varchar(500),
abstract varchar(5000),
type char(50),
pdf char(120),
file int not null unique,
url char(120),
note varchar(300),
date date );

Key, entrytype, author, year, and file are required for all entries.
Month and date will also be included for all entries.

Key is of form AuthorYear, ie Chang_etal00 or Itti_Koch00.

Entrytype is a coded integer.
1 = Article
2 = Book
3 = Booklet
4 = InBook
5 = InCollection
6 = InProceedings
7 = Manual
8 = MasterThesis
9 = Misc
10 = PhdThesis
11 = Proceedings
12 = TechReport
13 = Unpublished
14 = Patent

Volume, number, and pages are all character fields, so dashes or notations
such as "s" for supplement will not cause problems.

Month is an int, 1-12, or 0 if unknown.

Year is a 4-digit integer, or -1 if "In Press".

Use organization for organization, institution, or school.

File is the unique 5-digit file id number.  This number is writen at the
top of any physical copy of the publication we have on file.  In a BibTeX
entry, it is usually suffixed with ".pdf". If a paper has not been
filed yet, we assign it a number >= 10000

Date is the date the entry was added to the database.  Can be entered in
a variety of ways (ie mm/dd/yyy, or mon dd yyyy), but will automatically 
be converted by psql to yyyy-mm-dd format.
