installing the JournalTracker-to-HTML gateway:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This will automatically convert incoming emails from ISI's
JournalTracker service into HTML form.

- Create a new user "jtrack"
- in its home, edit .forward to read:

|/home/httpd/html/jtrack/jtracker2html.pl

- copy all the files and directories here to /home/httpd/html/jtrack/
  (or wherever you want them to become web-accessible)
- compile jt2bib and also put it there.
- access the HTML pages from your web browser.

NOTE: if your mailer is set in some paranoid mode, you will need to
declare jtracker2html.pl as being a valid script that can be executed
by .forward commands. For example, you would declare it in
/etc/smrsh. See your mailer's documentation for details (sendmail,
postfix, etc).
