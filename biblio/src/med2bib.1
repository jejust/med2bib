.SH NAME
med2bib, toc2bib \- convert MEDLINE and TOC/DOC records to BibTeX format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "med2bib [" medline-file "] [" bibtex-file ]

.BI "toc2bib [" tocdoc-file "] [" bibtex-file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B med2bib
converts MEDLINE full-record ASCII bibliographic entries for journal articles
into BibTeX entries.
.B toc2bib
converts TOC/DOC (the electronic literature search engine available at
Caltech) full-record entries.

All entries from
.I medline-file
or
.I tocdoc-file
are parsed, converted into BibTeX fields, and appended to the end of
.I bibtex-file
(no checking is done as to the nature of
.IR bibtex-file ).
If only one argument is given, it is the input, and stdout is the
output.  If no argument is given, stdin is the input and stdout the
output (for pipes).

A key is automatically generated for each entry. It is used in
\\cite{key} commands in LaTeX files, to cite the entry. Key generation
rules are:
.TP
If one author, year YY:
.B AuthorYY
(e.g., Wilson80)
.TP
If two authors, year YY:
.B Author1_Author2YY
(e.g., Hubel_Wiesel62)
.TP
If more than two authors, year YY:
.B Author1_etalYY
(e.g., Koch_etal96)
.P
No checking for duplicate keys is done. Only article BibTeX entries
are generated, with fields: author, title, journal (abbreviated in
MEDLINE but not in TOC/DOC), volume, number, pages (in short-hand
format, e.g., 1234-6), month (MEDLINE only), year, abstract, keyword
(separated by
.BR | ),
address, note (contains MEDLINE notes (e.g., publication of an erratum) and
language if not English).
.SH OPTIONS
none.
.SH FILES
.I medline-file
and
.I tocdoc-file
are obtained as follows:
.TP
.B MEDLINE by telnet (if you have a password):
After your search is done, type: 
.B mail med to you@domain.
Save the email (no need to strip the header) into
.I medline-file.
.TP
.B MEDLINE on the WWW: 
Found at http://www4.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/. Display the results in
MEDLINE format, and save as UNIX text into
.IR medline-file .
.TP
.B TOC/DOC by telnet (if you have a password):
After your search is done, type: 
.B e
(email), then 
.B 4
(TOC/DOC full record) and then enter your email address.  After you
receive the email, save it (no need to strip the header) into
.IR tocdoc-file .
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
For each entry processed, a citation in short-hand format is output to
stderr, to check for progress and bugs.
.SH BUGS
Many subtleties in formatting, or missing information in the MEDLINE
and TOC/DOC formats will create imperfect outputs. Please check the
documentation supplied with the programs.  In particular, in
.BR toc2bib ,
a heuristic algorithm is used to convert back to usual form the
all-capitalized titles and journal names. The algorithm has many
failure modes, and won't process correctly most acronyms or chemical
formulas.
