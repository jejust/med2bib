AB Divided attention (DA) in young subjects has been used as a model for the
   memory deficits associated with aging. Following this model, we assessed the
   effects of DA at encoding on the electrophysiological activity (ERPs) of
   young subjects. Individuals studied visually presented words under focused
   attention or while performing an auditory-motor task. Early positive (P120)
   and negative (N180) parietooccipital deflections were invariant across
   encoding conditions.  These peaks may reflect perceptual processes
   automatically initiated by words within the focus of visual attention.
   However, DA markedly attenuated two later positive components, the P280 and
   P580, maximally recorded over right parietal regions. These components may
   index conscious evaluation of word meaning (P280) and integration of the
   word with the encoding context (P580), suggesting that reduced attentional
   resources disrupt episodic encoding at both a conceptual and contextual
   level.

AB The authors present several versions of a general model, titled the E-Z
   Reader model, of eye movement control in reading. The major goal of the
   modeling is to relate cognitive processing (specifically aspects of lexical
   access) to eye movements in reading. The earliest and simplest versions of
   the model (E-Z Readers 1 and 2) merely attempt to explain the total time
   spent on a word before moving forward (the gaze duration) and the
   probability of fixating a word; later versions (E-Z Renders 3-5) also
   attempt to explain the durations of individual fixations on individual words
   and the number of fixations on individual words. The final version (E-Z
   Render 5) appears to be psychologically plausible and gives a good account
   of many phenomena in reading. It is also a good tool for analyzing eye
   movement data in reading. Limitations of the model and directions for future
   research are also discussed.

AB How does the saccadic movement system select a target when visual, auditory,
   and planned movement commands differ? How do retinal, head-centered, and
   motor error coordinates interact during the selection process? Recent data
   on superior colliculus (SC) reveal a spreading wave of activation across
   buildup cells the peak activity of which covaries with the current gaze
   error. In contrast, the locus of peak activity remains constant at burst
   cells, whereas their activity level decays with residual gaze error. A
   neural model answers these questions and simulates burst and buildup
   responses in visual, overlap, memory, and gap tasks. The model also
   simulates data on multimodal enhancement and suppression of activity in the
   deeper SC layers and suggests a functional role for NMDA receptors in this
   region. In particular, the model suggests how auditory and planned saccadic
   target positions become aligned and compete with Visually reactive target
   positions to select a movement command. For this to occur, a transformation
   between auditory and planned head-centered representations and a retinotopic
   target representation is learned. Burst cells in the model generate teaching
   signals to the spreading wave layer.  Spreading waves are produced by
   corollary discharges that render planned and visually reactive targets
   dimensionally consistent and enable them to compete for attention to
   generate a movement command in motor error coordinates, The attentional
   selection process also helps to stabilize the map-learning process. The
   model functionally interprets cells in the superior colliculus, frontal eye
   field, parietal cortex, mesencephalic reticular formation, paramedian
   pontine reticular formation, and substantia nigra pars reticulata.

AB Feedback connections from extrastriate cortex to primary visual cortex (V1)
   in the primate may provide ''top-down'' information that plays a role in
   visual attention and object recognition, Our work in a rodent model of
   corticocortical circuitry demonstrates that feedback pathways synapse
   preferentially with pyramidal cells in V1 (Johnson and Burkhalter, 1996) and
   favor excitation over inhibition in cortical microcircuits (Shao and
   Burkhalter, 1996).
   To investigate the polysynaptic circuits activated by feedback inputs, we
   studied chains of neurons postsynaptic to feedback connections using a
   combination of axonal tract tracing and anterograde degeneration, This
   approach enabled independent labeling of local collaterals of
   forward-projecting neurons in V1 and feedback connections from extrastriate
   lateromedial (LM) visual area to V1. Postsynaptic targets were identified in
   the electron microscope after retrograde transport of biotinylated dextran
   amine (BDA) to identify dendrites of forward-projecting neurons (i.e., from
   V1 to LM) and postembedding immunogold labeling to identify GABAergic
   interneurons,
   The results show that feedback connections provide strong monosynaptic input
   to forward-projecting neurons in V1, These neurons in turn make local
   connections that preferentially form synapses with other pyramidal cells.
   (similar to 97%), many of which were identified as forward-projecting
   neurons. This indicates that feedback pathways provide input directly to
   neurons which make the reciprocal forward connection, and that
   feedback-recipient forward-projecting neurons are strongly interconnected,
   The function of these excitatory networks within V1 may be to amplify
   feedback activity and provide a circuit for modulation of striate cortical
   activity by top-down influences.

   information from the lower to the higher levels of the visual system. The
   model is kept as simple as possible, but it is still capable of reproducing
   attentional behavior observed in psychological experiments. Computer
   simulations demonstrate that (1) it can learn categories to reduce reaction
   time without a decrease in performance, (2) the model reveals a performance

AB Despite the fact that visual extinction is widely considered a space-based
   disturbance of selective attention, there has been little theoretical
   consensus about the nature of its pathogenic mechanism. A specific
   disruption in the ability to disengage attention from ipsilesional stimuli,
   or a loss of weight with which contralesional objects compete for visual
   selection, have been hypothesized to account for the disorder. We tested the
   merits of these two explanations in a right-hemisphere-lesioned patient, FB,
   who failed to recognize a contralesional target only when it was shown
   concurrently to an ipsilesional target (i.e. visual extinction). His task
   was to report two target letters presented in rapid succession to the left
   and right of the fixation point. The order of stimulus presentation
   (Left-First vs Right-First), and the intertarget interval (stimulus onset
   asynchrony) were varied systematically.  We showed that contralesional
   extinction may occur for successively presented targets, not just for
   stimuli displayed at the same time. Of most importance, FB was seriously and
   equally impaired in dealing with a contralesional stimulus when this either
   preceded the ipsilesional stimulus or followed it by an interval less than
   about 600 msec. The data appear to contradict the disengagement hypothesis,
   which predicted a substantial reduction of extinction when a stimulus was
   displayed first into the lesioned side of space. We suggest that a
   competitive model of visual selective attention fits the data quite well.

   performed three tasks on horizontal(either normal or mirror-reversed) letter

   non-word), and making a semantic decision (living vs non-living item).
   Relative to controls, neglect patients performed very poorly in the reading
   task, whereas they performed nearly normally in the lexical and semantic
   tasks. This was considered to be a dissociation between direct tasks, rather
   than a dissociation between explicit and implicit knowledge. The explanation
   offered for the dissociation is in terms of both a dual-route model for
   reading aloud and a degraded representation of the letter string. (C) 1997

AB A cued reaction time task was used to test the hypothesis that there is an
   'object-based' component to shifts of attention mediating the detection of
   luminance increment targets. The test stimulus consisted of two intersecting
   triangles forming a 'Star of David'.  In two experiments, the cue was a
   brief brightening of one triangle.  The target (a bright green dot) appeared
   on one of the triangles after a delay of 100, 200 or 500 msec. In one
   experiment, the target was more likely to appear on the cued triangle. In a
   second experiment, there was no contingency between cue and target. In both
   cases, reaction times to targets which appeared outside (but not inside) the
   cued triangle were more than 10 msec longer than other targets, but only al
   the shorter cue-target delays. This indicates that the attentional system
   which regulates luminance increment detection cannot select the cued
   triangle. It appears that the attentional spotlight can be briefly deformed
   into a triangular shape, and that it is the rapid, fast-decaying and
   reflexive exogenous system, rather than the slower acting, persistent and
   voluntary endogenous system, that mediates this effect. A third experiment
   using a central, symbolic cue showed no significant cue-validity effects,
   indicating no contribution from the endogenous system. It is concluded that
   tasks requiring only stimulus detection cannot unequivocally discriminate
   between spatial and object-based components of attention. (C) 1997 Elsevier

   In two experiments it was found that the primary effect of attention was to
   reduce the variability of line length adjustments. Previously investigators

AB As a step toward understanding the mechanism by which targets are selected
   for smooth-pursuit eye movements, we examined the behavior of the pursuit
   system when monkeys were presented with two discrete moving visual targets.
   Two rhesus monkeys were trained to select a small moving target identified
   by its color in the presence of a moving distracter of another color.
   Smooth-pursuit eye movements were quantified in terms of the latency of the
   eye movement and the initial eye acceleration profile. We have previously
   shown that the latency of smooth pursuit, which is normally around 100 ms,
   can be extended to 150 ms or shortened to 85 ms depending on whether there
   is a distracter moving in the opposite or same direction, respectively,
   relative to the direction of the target.  We have now measured this effect
   for a 360 deg range of distracter directions, and distracter speeds of 5-45
   deg/s. We have also examined the effect of varying the spatial separation
   and temporal asynchrony between target and distracter. The results indicate
   that the effect of the distracter on the latency of pursuit depends on its
   direction of motion, and its spatial and temporal proximity to the target,
   but depends very little on the speed of the distracter.  Furthermore, under
   the conditions of these experiments, the direction of the eye movement that
   is emitted in response to two competing moving stimuli is not a vectorial
   combination of the stimulus motions, but is solely determined by the
   direction of the target.  The results are consistent with a competitive
   model for smooth-pursuit target selection and suggest that the competition
   takes place at a stage of the pursuit pathway that is between visual-motion
   processing and motor-response preparation.

AB Attention is a mechanism to select sensory information. It is a modulatory
   process which normally cannot be observed as overt responses. We have
   studied spatial attention using a new visual illusion of motion -
   line-motion effect: a line, which was presented physically at once, was
   perceived to be drawn from ocne side when attention was captured to that
   side of the line by a preceding visual cue stimulus. This effect was due to
   acceleration of visual information processing at the locus of attention. The
   motion illusion was produced by both stimulus-induced (bottom-up) and
   voluntary (top-down) attention, which suggested that the two kinds of
   attention act on relatively early stages of visual processing. The objective
   of this study was to examine how various modes of spatial attention might be
   represented and reorganized in the brain. Using the induction of illusory
   Line motion as a measure we found that: (1) once attention is captured by a
   moving object, it follows the object as it moves; and (2) attention moves
   with a saccade in the retinal coordinates such that its focus remains fixed
   in space. We then asked whether attention acts across different sensory
   modalities. We found that both auditory and somatosensory cues induced focal
   visual attention in space where the cue was presented. Based on these
   findings we propose a model which would allow (1) matching of visual spatial
   information obtained across saccades, and (2) matching of spatial
   information obtained in different sensory modalities.

   in patients with severe neglect dyslexia for words and non-words. Patients
   were given the following tasks: (1) reading aloud letter strings (first
   basic reading task), (2) making semantic decisions (categorial and
   inferential judgements), (3) making semantic decisions and reading the
   letter strings immediately afterwards (semantic-reading tasks), (4) reading
   letter strings again (final basic reading tasks) and (5) auditory control
   tasks.  Of 23 patients with Visual neglect, four showed neglect dyslexia for
   both words and non-words. Of these four patients, three showed, a
   performance in the semantic tasks that was as good as in the auditory
   condition. Moreover, the reading of the patients improved dramatically in
   the semantic-reading tasks but this was not maintained in the final basic
   reading task. Non-words showed only a minor improvement. Findings are
   discussed in terms of an interaction between the attentional system and the
   different reading routes, and provide evidence that semantic routes are less

AB Involuntary switching to task-irrelevant sound change was studied by
   measuring event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and behavioral performance
   in a dichotic listening paradigm. Pairs of tones (S1 and S2) were presented
   and subjects were instructed to ignore ST (delivered to the left ear) and to
   make a go/no-go response to the subsequent S2 (delivered to the right ear).
   On most trials, the task-irrelevant S1 was of standard frequency, but
   occasionally it deviated from the standard frequency either by a small or
   large amount. It was predicted that deviant stimuli were automatically
   detected and that they could involuntarily capture attention.  It they lead
   to attention switching, less capacity should be available for the processing
   of target tones resulting in impaired processing of S2. As in many previous
   studies, deviant tones elicited the mismatch negativity (MMN), which is a
   component of the ERP indicating automatic change detection. Furthermore,
   targets preceded by a deviant tone elicited a smaller N1 wave and were
   detected less effectively than targets preceded by a standard tone. This
   impaired processing of targets following cask-irrelevant changes occurred
   only with short S1-S2 intervals (Experiment I) but not with long ones
   (Experiment II). The results support a model claiming that the auditory
   system possesses a change detection system that monitors the acoustic input
   and may produce an attentional ''interrupt'' signal when a deviant occurs.
   The involuntary attentional capture caused by this signal leads to
   impoverished processing of closely succeeding stimuli.

AB If the spatial-frequency of sinusoidal signals in a contrast-detection
   experiment varies randomly from trial to trial, then performance is
   decreased compared with that in a situation where it remains constant. This
   spatial-frequency uncertainty effect can more or less be compensated by
   presenting informative cues shortly before each trial. Single-band, as well
   as multiple-band models, have been proposed to explain the uncertainty and
   cuing effects. While the latter assume that under uncertainty multiple
   channels are monitored simultaneously, the former propose that in each trial
   a single, but sometimes inappropriate, channel is selected for monitoring,
   Until now it is open which of these models is valid.  Therefore,
   psychometric functions were collected under different conditions of

   multiple-band model, as computational analysis reveals. Copyright (C) 1996

AB A new test was devised to avoid previous confounds in measures of
   object-based limits on divided visual attention. The distinction between
   objects was manipulated across a wide spatial extent.  Target elements
   appeared on the same object only when far apart, and appeared close only
   when on different objects, so that object effects could not be reduced to
   spatial effects, nor vice versa.  Subjects judged whether two odd elements
   within a display of two dashed lines were the same or different. They
   performed better when the target elements were far apart on a common line
   rather than on two distinct lines, even though the latter arrangement was
   more likely. Thus, nonstrategic object-based limits on divided attention can
   arise even across large distances. However, when subjects were precued to
   expect targets in a narrow region of the display, the object effect was
   eliminated, implying that object-based selection may only operate within
   spatially attended regions.

AB WE are able to move visual attention away from the direction of gaze,
   fixating on one object while attending to something else at a different
   location. Within the region of peripheral vision, It has been widely assumed
   that the attentional neural systems are separate from the motor systems, but
   some studies challenge this idea(1-5). It has now been suggested that the
   attentional system is part of the premotor processing in the brain(6). This
   model proposes that attentional processes evolved as part of the motor
   systems, with isolated attentional shifts representing an artificial
   separation of a natural linkage, Here we test how attentional shifts might
   be linked to the preparations for making saccadic eye movements. We studied
   the superior colliculus in monkeys as they shifted their attention during
   different tasks, and found that each attentional shift is associated with
   eye-movement preparation.

AB This article presents a theory that integrates space-based and object-based
   approaches to visual attention. The theory puts together M. P. van Oeffelen
   and P. G. Vos's(1982, 1983) COntour DEtector (CODE) theory of perceptual
   grouping by proximity with C. Bundesen's (1990) theory of visual attention
   (TVA). CODE provides input to TVA, accounting for spatially based
   between-object selection, and TVA converts the input to output, accounting
   for feature- and category-based within-object selection. CODE clusters
   nearby items into perceptual groups that are both perceptual objects and
   regions of space, thereby integrating object-based and space-based
   approaches to attention. The combined theory provides a quantitative account
   of the effects of grouping by proximity and distance between items on
   reaction time and accuracy data in ? empirical situations that shaped the
   current literature on visual spatial attention.

AB A series of experiments investigated concurrent discriminations of surface
   and nonsurface attributes, including color, brightness, texture, length,
   location, and motion. In all cases but one, results matched those previously
   reported: Interference occurred when two discriminations concerned different
   objects, but not when they concerned the same one. In the two-object case,
   interference was the same whether discriminations were similar (e.g., two
   surface discriminations) or different (e.g., one surface, one boundary). 
   Such results support a model of visual attention in which separate visual
   subsystems are coordinated, converging to work on surface and boundary
   properties of the same selected object. A partial exception is color: For
   reasons that are unclear color escapes two-object interference except from
   other, concurrent surface discriminations.
