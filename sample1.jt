T1  - Relative contribution by GABA or glycine to Cl--mediated synaptic
      transmission on rat hypoglossal motoneurons in vitro

N2  - The relative contribution by GABA and glycine to synaptic
      transmission of motoneurons was investigated using an hypoglossus
      nucleus slice preparation from neonatal rats. Spontaneous, miniature,
      or electrically evoked postsynaptic currents (sPSCs, mPSCs, ePSCs,
      respectively) mediated by glycine or GABA were recorded under whole
      cell voltage clamp after blocking excitatory glutamatergic
      transmission with kynurenic acid. The overall majority of Cl- -
      mediated sPSCs was glycinergic, while only one-third was GABAergic;
      70 +/- 10% of mPSCs were glycinergic while 22 +/- 8% were GABAergic.
      Tetrodotoxin (TTX) application dramatically reduced the frequency
      (and slightly the amplitude) of GABAergic events without changing
      frequency or amplitude of glycinergic sPSCs. These results indicate
      that, unlike spontaneous GABAergic transmission, glycine-mediated
      neurotransmission was essentially independent of network activity.
      There was a consistent difference in the kinetics of GABAergic and
      glycinergic responses as GABAergic events had significantly slower
      rise and decay times than glycinergic ones. Such a difference was
      always present whenever sPSCs, mPSCs, or ePSCs were measured.
      Finally, GABAergic and glycinergic mPSCs were differentially
      modulated by activation of glutamate metabotropic receptors (mGluRs),
      which are abundant in the hypoglossus nucleus. In fact, the broad-
      spectrum mGluR agonist (+/-)-1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-
      dicarboxylic acid (50 muM), which in control solution increased the
      frequency of both GABAergic and glycinergic sPSCs, enhanced the
      frequency of glycinergic mPSCs only. These results indicate that on
      brain stem motoneurons, Cl- -mediated synaptic transmission is mainly
      due to glycine rather than GABA and that GABAergic and glycinergic
      events differ in terms of kinetics and pharmacological sensitivity to
      mGluR activation or TTX.

T1  - Task-dependent modulation of the sensorimotor transformation for
      smooth pursuit eye movements
AU  - Ferrera,V.P.

EP  - 2738
N2  - To investigate the transformation of retinal image velocity into
      smooth pursuit eye velocity, eye movements were measured in the
      presence of two moving targets. In the first experiment, the targets
      were identical in all respects except for direction of motion, and
      the monkey was not cued to attend to either target. In this
      experiment, smooth pursuit eye velocity elicited by two targets was
      the vector average of the response evoked by each target alone. In
      subsequent experiments, we examined the effects of stimulus and task
      parameters on the selectivity of pursuit. When the targets were made
      different colors and monkeys were cued for the color of the rewarded
      target, their pursuit eye movements were biased in the direction of
      the rewarded target, but still showed a substantial influence of the
      nonrewarded target (distractor). It did not matter whether the same
      target color was used for an entire session or whether the color was
      randomized from trial to trial. Reducing uncertainty about the axis
      of motion of the rewarded target also had little effect. However, the
      pattern of image motion appeared to have a substantial effect; radial
      image motion favored averaging, and winner-take-all pursuit was found
      only with nonradial image motion. We conclude that the sensorimotor
      interface for pursuit uses a flexible decision rule that can vary
      continuously from vector averaging to winner-take-all. We present a
      simple recurrent network model that reflects this range of behavior.
      The model has allowed us to identify three computational elements
      (selection bias, competitive inhibition, and response normalization)
      that should be taken into consideration in future models of smooth
      pursuit.

N2  - cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is believed to play a critical
      role in the expression of long-lasting forms of hippocampal long-term
      potentiation (LTP). Can distinct patterns of synaptic activity induce
      forms of LTP that require different isoforms of PKA? To address this
      question, we used transgenic mice that have genetically reduced
      hippocampal PKA activity, and a specific pharmacological inhibitor of
      PKA, Rp-cAMPS. Transgenic mice [R(AB) mice] that express an
      inhibitory form of a particular type of regulatory subunit of PKA
      (type-I alpha) showed significantly reduced LTP in area CA1 of
      hippocampal slices as compared with slices from wild-type mice. This
      impairment of LTP expression was evident when LTP was induced by
      applying repeated, temporally spaced stimulation (4 1-s bursts of 100-
      Hz applied once every 5 min). In contrast, LTP induced by applying
      just 60 pulses in a theta-burst pattern was normal in slices from R(
      AB) mice as compared with slices from wild-type mice. We found that
      Rp-cAMPS blocked the expression of LTP induced by both spaced tetra-
      burst and compressed theta-burst stimulation in hippocampal slices of
      wild-type and R( AB) mice, respectively. Since Rp-cAMPS is a PKA
      inhibitor that is not selective for any particular isoform of PKA and
      these R( AB) mice show reduced hippocampal PKA activity resulting
      from genetic manipulation of a single isoform of PKA regulatory
      subunit, our data support the idea that distinct patterns of synaptic
      activity can produce different forms of LTP that significantly engage
      different isoforms of PKA. In particular, theta-burst LTP
      significantly recruits isoforms of PKA containing regulatory subunits
      other than the mutant RI alpha subunit, whereas tetra-burst LTP
      requires PKA isoforms containing the mutant RI a subunit. Thus,
      altering both the total amount of imposed synaptic activity and the
      temporal spacing between bursts of imposed activity may subtly
      modulate the PKA dependence of hippocampal LTP by engaging distinct
      isoforms of PKA. In a broader context, our findings suggest that
      synaptic plasticity in the mammalian brain might be importantly
      regulated by activity-dependent recruitment of different isoforms of
      key signal transduction molecules.

T1  - Freshly isolated astrocytes from rat hippocampus show two distinct
      current patterns and different [K+](o) uptake capabilities

EP  - 2757
N2  - Whether astrocytes predominantly express ohmic K+ channels in vivo,
      and how expression of different K+ channels affects [K+](o)
      homeostasis in the CNS have been long-standing questions for how
      astrocytes function. In the present study, we have addressed some of
      these questions in glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP(+)], freshly
      isolated astrocytes (FIAs) from CA1 and CA3 regions of P7-15 rat
      hippocampus. As isolated, these astrocytes were uncoupled allowing a
      higher resolution of electrophysiological study. FIAs showed two
      distinct ion current profiles, with neither showing a purely linear I-
      V relationship. One population of astrocytes had a combined
      expression of outward potassium currents (I-Ka, I-Kd) and inward
      sodium currents (I-Na). We term these outwardly rectifying astrocytes
      (ORA). Another population of astrocytes is characterized by a
      relatively symmetric potassium current pattern, comprising outward I-
      Ka, I-Kd, and abundant inward potassium currents (I-Kin), and a
      larger membrane capacitance (C-m) and more negative resting membrane
      potential (RMP) than ORAs. We term these variably rectifying
      astrocytes (VRA). The I-Kin in 70% of the VRAs was essentially
      insensitive to Cs+, while I-Kin in the remaining 30% of VRAs was
      sensitive. The I-Ka of VRAs was most sensitive to 4-aminopyridine (4-
      AP), while I-Kdr of ORAs was more sensitive to tetraethylammonium
      (TEA). ORAs and VRAs occurred approximately equally in FIAs isolated
      from the CA1 region (52% ORAs versus 48% VRAs), but ORAs were
      enriched in FIAs isolated from the CA3 region (71% ORAs versus 29%
      VRAs), suggesting an anatomical segregation of these two types of
      astrocytes within the hippocampus. VRAs, but not ORAs, showed robust
      inward currents in response to an increase in extracellular K+ from 5
      to 10 mM. As VRAs showed a similar current pattern and other passive
      membrane properties (e.g., RMP, R-in) to "passive astrocytes" in situ
      (i.e., these showing linear I-V curves), such passive astrocytes
      possibly represent VRAs influenced by extensive gap-junction coupling
      in situ. Thus, our data suggest that, at least in CA1 and CA3 regions
      from P7-15 rats, there are two classes of GFAP(+) astrocytes which
      possess different K+ currents. Only VRAs seem suited to uptake of
      extracellular K+ via I-Kin channels at physiological membrane
      potentials and increases of [K+](o). ORAs show abundant outward
      potassium currents with more depolarized RMP. Thus VRAs and ORAs may
      cooperate in vivo for uptake and release of K+, respectively.

N2  - Lamprey spinal cord neurons possess N-, L-, and P/Q-type high-voltage-
      activated (HVA) calcium channels. We have analyzed the role of the
      different HVA calcium channels subtypes in the overall functioning of
      the spinal locomotor network by monitoring the influence of their
      specific agonists and antagonists on synaptic transmission and on N-
      methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-elicited fictive locomotion. The N- type
      calcium channel blocker omega -conotoxin GVIA (omega -CgTx) depressed
      synaptic transmission from excitatory and inhibitory interneurons.
      Blocking L-type and P/Q-type calcium channels with nimodipine and
      omega -agatoxin, respectively, did not affect synaptic transmission.
      Application of omega -CgTx initially decreased the frequency of the
      locomotor rhythm, increased the burst duration, and subsequently
      increased the coefficient of variation and disrupted the motor
      pattern. These effects were accompanied by a depression of the
      synaptic drive between neurons in the locomotor network. Blockade of
      L-type channels by nimodipine also decreased the frequency and
      increased the duration of the locomotor bursts. Conversely,
      potentiation of L-type channels increased the frequency of the
      locomotor activity and decreased the duration of the ventral root
      bursts. In contrast to blockade of N- type channels, blockade or
      potentiation of L-type calcium channels had no effect on the
      stability of the locomotor pattern. The P/Q-type calcium channel
      blocker omega -agatoxin IVA had little effect on the locomotor
      frequency or burst duration. The results indicate that rhythm
      generation in the spinal locomotor network of the lamprey relies on
      calcium influx through L-type and N-type calcium channels.

      in kinetic properties and developmental expression

N2  - The intrinsic electrical properties of identified choroid and ciliary
      neurons of the chick ciliary ganglion were examined by patch-clamp
      recording methods. These neurons are derived from a common pool of
      mesencephalic neural crest precursor cells but innervate different
      target tissues and have markedly different action potential waveforms
      and intrinsic patterns of repetitive spike discharge. Therefore it is
      important to determine whether these cell types express different
      types of plasma membrane ionic channels, and to ascertain the
      developmental stages at which these cell types begin to diverge. This
      study has focused on large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (K-
      Ca), which are known to regulate spike waveform and repetitive firing
      in many cell types. Both ciliary ganglion cell types, identified on
      the basis of size and somatostatin immunoreactivity, express a robust
      macroscopic K-Ca carried by a kinetically homogeneous population of
      large-conductance (BK-type) K-Ca channels. However, the kinetic
      properties of these channels are different in the two cell types.
      Steady-state fluctuation analyses of macroscopic K-Ca produced power
      spectra that could be fitted with a single Lorentzian curve in both
      cell types. However, the resulting corner frequency was significantly
      lower in choroid neurons than in ciliary neurons, suggesting that the
      underlying K-Ca channels have a longer mean open-time in choroid
      neurons. Consistent with fluctuation analyses, significantly slower
      gating of K-Ca channels in choroid neurons was also observed during
      macroscopic activation and deactivation at membrane potentials
      positive to -30 mV. Differences in the kinetic properties of K-Ca
      channels could also be observed directly in single-channel recordings
      from identified embryonic day 13 choroid and ciliary neurons. The
      mean open-time of large-conductance K-Ca channels was significantly
      greater in choroid neurons than in ciliary neurons in excised inside-
      out patches. The developmental expression of functional K-Ca channels
      appears to be regulated differently in the two cell types. Although
      both cell types acquire functional K-Ca at the same developmental
      stages (embryonic days 9-13), functional expression of these channels
      in ciliary neurons requires target-derived trophic factors. In
      contrast, expression of functional K-Ca channels proceeds normally in
      choroid neurons developing in vitro in the absence of target-derived
      trophic factors. Consistent with this, extracts of ciliary neuron
      target tissues (striated muscle of the iris/ciliary body) contain K-
      Ca stimulatory activity. However, K-Ca stimulatory activity cannot be
      detected in extracts of the smooth muscle targets of choroid neurons.

N2  - Myenteric afterhyperpolarizing (AH) neurons are primary afferent
      neurons within the gastrointestinal tract. Stimulation of the
      intestinal mucosa evokes action potentials (AP) that are followed by
      a slow afterhyperpolarization (AHP(slow)) in the soma. The role of
      intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+](i)) and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores in
      modulating the electrical activity of myenteric AH neurons was
      investigated by recording membrane potential and bis-fura-2
      fluorescence from 34 AH neurons. Mean resting [Ca2+](i) was similar
      to 200 nM. Depolarizing current pulses that elicited APs evoked
      AHP(slow) and an increase in [Ca2+](i), with similar time courses.
      The amplitudes and durations of AHP(slow) and the Ca2+ transient were
      proportional to the number of evoked APs, with each AP increasing
      [Ca2+](i) by similar to 50 nM. Ryanodine (10 muM) significantly
      reduced both the amplitude and duration (by 60%) of the evoked Ca2+
      transient and AHP(slow) over the range of APs tested (1-15). Calcium-
      induced calcium release (CICR) was graded and proportional to the
      number of APs, with each AP triggering a rise in [Ca2+](i) of similar
      to 30 nM Ca2+ via CICR. This indicates that CICR amplifies Ca2+
      influx. Similar changes in [Ca2+](i) and AHP(slow) were evoked by two
      APs in control and six APs in ryanodine. Thus, the magnitude of the
      change in bulk [Ca2+](i) and not the source of the Ca2+ is the
      determinant of the magnitude of AHP(slow). Furthermore, lowering of
      free [Ca2+](i), either by reducing extracellular Ca2+ or injecting
      high concentrations of Ca2+ buffer, induced depolarization, increased
      excitability, and abolition of AHP(slow). In addition, activation of
      synaptic input to AH neurons elicited a slow excitatory postsynaptic
      potential (sEPSP) that was completely blocked in ryanodine. These
      results demonstrate the importance of [Ca2+](i) and CICR in sensory
      processing in AH neurons. Activity-dependent CICR may be a mechanism
      to grade the output of AH neurons according to the intensity of
      sensory input.

N2  - We recorded responses in 107 cells in the primary visual area V1 and
      113 cells in the extrastriate visual area V2 while presenting a
      kinetically defined edge or a luminance contrast edge. Cells meeting
      statistical criteria for responsiveness and orientation selectivity
      were classified as selective for the orientation of the kinetic edge
      if the preferred orientation for a kinetic boundary stimulus remained
      essentially the same even when the directions of the two motion
      components defining that boundary were changed by 90 degrees. In area
      V2, 13 of the 113 cells met all three requirements, whereas in V1,
      only 4 cells met the criteria of 107 that were tested, and even these
      demonstrated relatively weak selectivity. Correlation analysis showed
      that V1 and V2 populations differed greatly (P < 1.0 x 10(-6),
      Student's t-test) in their selectively for specific orientations of
      kinetic edge stimuli. Neurons in V2 that were selective for the
      orientation of a kinetic boundary were further distinguished from
      their counterparts in V1 in displaying a strong, sharply tuned
      response to a luminance edge of the same orientation. We concluded
      that selectivity for the orientation of kinetically defined
      boundaries first emerges in area V2 rather than in primary visual
      cortex. An analysis of response onset latencies in V2 revealed that
      cells selective for the orientation of the motion-defined boundary
      responded about 40 ms more slowly, on average, to the kinetic edge
      stimulus than to a luminance edge. In nonselective cells, that is,
      those presumably responding only to the local motion in the stimulus,
      this difference was only about 20 ms. Response latencies for the
      luminance edge were indistinguishable in KE-selective and -
      nonselective neurons. We infer that while responses to luminance
      edges or local motion are indigenous to V2, KE-selective responses
      may involve feedback entering the ventral stream at a point
      downstream with respect to V2.

N2  - Dopaminergic modulation of neuronal networks in the dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) is believed to play an important role in
      information processing during working memory tasks in both humans and
      nonhuman primates. To understand the basic cellular mechanisms that
      underlie these actions of dopamine (DA), we have investigated the
      influence of DA on the cellular properties of layer 3 pyramidal cells
      in area 46 of the macaque monkey PFC. Intracellular voltage
      recordings were obtained with sharp and whole cell patch-clamp
      electrodes in a PFC brain-slice preparation. All of the recorded
      neurons in layer 3 (n = 86) exhibited regular spiking firing
      properties consistent with those of pyramidal neurons. We found that
      DA had no significant effects on resting membrane potential or input
      resistance of these cells. However DA, at concentrations as low as
      0.5 muM, increased the excitability of PFC cells in response to
      depolarizing current steps injected at the soma. Enhanced
      excitability was associated with a hyperpolarizing shift in action
      potential threshold and a decreased first interspike interval. These
      effects required activation of D1-like but not D2-like receptors
      since they were inhibited by the D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (3
      muM) but not significantly altered by the D2 antagonist sulpiride
      (2.5 muM). These results show, for the first time, that DA modulates
      the activity of layer 3 pyramidal neurons in area 46 of monkey
      dorsolateral PFC in vitro. Furthermore the results suggest that, by
      means of these effects alone, DA modulation would generally enhance
      the response of PFC pyramidal neurons to excitatory currents that
      reach the action potential initiation site.

N2  - Plasticity of Aplysia feeding has largely been measured by noting
      changes in radula protraction. On the basis of previous work, it has
      been suggested that peripheral modulation may contribute to
      behavioral plasticity. However, peripheral plasticity has not been
      demonstrated in the neuromuscular systems that participate in radula
      protraction. Therefore in this study we investigated whether
      contractions of a major radula protraction muscle (I2) are subject to
      modulation. We demonstrate, first, that an increase in the firing
      frequency of the cholinergic I2 motoneurons will increase the
      amplitude of the resulting muscle contraction but will not modulate
      its relaxation rate. We show, second, that neuronal processes on the
      I2 muscle are immunoreactive to myomodulin (MM), RF-amide, and
      serotonin (5-HT), but not to small cardioactive peptide (SCP) or
      buccalin. The I2 motoneurons B31, B32, B61, and B62 are not
      immunoreactive to RFamide, 5-HT, SCP, or buccalin. However, all four
      cells are MM immunoreactive and are capable of synthesizing MMa.
      Third, we show that the bioactivity of the different modulators is
      somewhat different; while the MMs (i.e., MMa and MMb) and 5-HT
      increase I2 muscle relaxation rate, and potentiate muscle contraction
      amplitude, MMa, at high concentrations, depresses muscle
      contractions. Fourth, our data suggest that cAMP at least partially
      mediates effects of modulators on contraction amplitude and
      relaxation rate.

N2  - We examined the ability of the isolated lumbosacral spinal cord of
      the neonatal mouse (P0-7) to generate rhythmic motor activity under
      several different conditions. In the absence of electrical or
      pharmacological stimulation, we recorded several patterns of
      spontaneous ventral root depolarization and discharge. Spontaneous,
      alternating discharge between contralateral ventral roots could occur
      two to three times over a 10-min interval. We also observed other
      patterns, including left-right synchrony and rhythmic activity
      restricted to one side of the cord. Trains of stimuli delivered to
      the lumbar/coccygeal dorsal roots or the sural nerve reliably evoked
      episodes of rhythmic activity. During these evoked episodes, rhythmic
      ventral root discharges could occur on one side of the cord or could
      alternate from side to side. Bath application of a combination of N-
      methyl-D,L-aspartate (NMA), serotonin, and dopamine produced rhythmic
      activity that could last for several hours. Under these conditions,
      the discharge recorded from the left and right L-1-L-3 ventral roots
      alternated. In the L-4-L-5 segments, the discharge had two peaks in
      each cycle, coincident with discharge of the ipsilateral and
      contralateral L-1-L-3 roots. The L-6 ventral root discharge
      alternated with that recorded from the ipsilateral L-1-L-3 roots. We
      established that the drug-induced rhythm was locomotor-like by
      recording an alternating pattern of discharge between ipsilateral
      flexor and extensor hindlimb muscle nerves. In addition, by recording
      simultaneously from ventral roots and muscle nerves, we established
      that ankle flexor discharge was in phase with ipsilateral L-1/L-2
      ventral root discharge, while extensor discharge was in phase with
      ipsilateral L6 ventral root discharge. Rhythmic patterns of ventral
      root discharge were preserved following mid-sagittal section of the
      spinal cord, demonstrating that reciprocal inhibitory connections
      between the left and right sides of the cord are not essential for
      rhythmogenesis in the neonatal mouse cord. Blocking N-methyl-D-
      aspartate receptors, in both the intact and the hemisected
      preparation, revealed that these receptors contribute to but are not
      essential for rhythmogenesis. In contrast, the rhythm was abolished
      following blockade of kainate/AMPA receptors with 6-cyano-7-
      nitroquinoxalene-2,3- dione. These findings demonstrate that the
      isolated mouse spinal cord can produce a variety of coordinated
      activities, including locomotor-like activity. The ability to study
      these behaviors under a variety of different conditions offers
      promise for future studies of rhythmogenic mechanisms in this
      preparation.

      after transient forebrain ischemia

N2  - CA1 pyramidal neurons are highly vulnerable to transient cerebral
      ischemia. In vivo studies have shown that the excitability of CA1
      neurons progressively decreased following reperfusion. To reveal the
      mechanisms underlying the postischemic excitability change, total
      potassium current, transient potassium current, and delayed rectifier
      potassium current in CA1 neurons were studied in hippocampal slices
      prepared before ischemia and at different time points following
      reperfusion. Consistent with previous in vivo studies, the
      excitability of CA1 neurons decreased in brain slices prepared at 14
      h following transient forebrain ischemia. The amplitude of total
      potassium current in CA1 neurons increased similar to 30% following
      reperfusion. The steady-state activation curve of total potassium
      current progressively shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction with a
      transient recovery at 18 h after ischemia. For transient potassium
      current, the amplitude was transiently increased similar to 30% at
      similar to 12 h after reperfusion and returned to control levels at
      later time points. The steady-state activation curve also shifted
      similar to 20 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction, and the time
      constant of removal of inactivation markedly increased at 12 h after
      reperfusion. For delayed rectifier potassium current, the amplitude
      significantly increased and the steady-state activation curve shifted
      in the hyperpolarizing direction at 36 h after reperfusion. No
      significant change in inactivation kinetics was observed in the above
      potassium currents following reperfusion. The present study
      demonstrates the differential changes of potassium currents in CA1
      neurons after reperfusion. The increase of transient potassium
      current in the early phase of reperfusion may be responsible for the
      decrease of excitability, while the increase of delayed rectifier
      potassium current in the late phase of reperfusion may be associated
      with the postischemic cell death.

N2  - The present study investigated the effects of repeated cold stress on
      single neuron activity in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and
      medial hypothalamic area (MHA) of behaving rats. The rats were
      trained to lick a protruding spout in response to one of several cue-
      tone stimuli (CTSs) to ingest water, or amino acid, NaCl or glucose
      solution. Following this training, the rats were raised under either
      stressed (repeated temperature changes between -3 and 24 degreesC) or
      control (24 degreesC) condition for 2 mo. During this period,
      neuronal activity was recorded in the LHA and MHA. For rats raised
      under the stressed condition, mean spontaneous firing rate of LHA
      neurons was significantly greater than for rats under the control
      condition. More LHA neurons in the stressed rats responded, with an
      accompanying decrease in activity (inhibitory response), to CTSs than
      in the control rats. During extinction learning, some LHA neurons
      enhanced or reversed the responses to CTSs in the stressed rats,
      whereas no LHA neurons showed such response changes in the control
      rats. In contrast to the effects of the stressed condition on LHA
      neuron activity, mean spontaneous firing rate of MHA neurons in the
      stressed rats was significantly smaller than in the control rats.
      Fewer MHA neurons in the stressed rats responded to CTSs and/or
      ingestion of sapid solutions. The preceding results suggested that
      repeated cold stress produces a specific pattern of changes in
      spontaneous activity and responses to sensory stimuli in LHA and MHA
      neurons; this could underlie the behavioral changes induced by
      repeated cold stress such as hyperphagia and hyper-reactivity to
      sensory stimuli.

N2  - We investigated the periodic characteristics of bursting discharge in
      renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in conscious rats. Employing
      a discrete fast Fourier transform algorithm, a power spectrum
      analysis was used to quantify periodicities present in rectified and
      integrated RSNA whose signal-to-noise ratio in the recordings was
      greater than six. In conscious rats with intact baroreceptors, RSNA
      was characterized by four frequency components occurring at about
      0.5, 1.5, 6, and 12 Hz, which corresponded to the low-frequency
      fluctuation of heart rate, respiration, and frequency of heart beat,
      and its harmonics, respectively. After intravenous infusion of sodium
      nitroprusside (SNP) to elicit reflex increases in RSNA and heart
      rate, the power for the component at 6 Hz followed the changes in
      heart beat frequency and was significantly increased, while those for
      the three other components were attenuated or experienced no change.
      In sino-aortic denervated (SAD) conscious rats, all four components
      were abolished, and the power spectrum was well fitted by a flat or
      Lorentzian curve, suggesting an almost random pattern. Only a
      respiratory-related component, which suggested common central
      modulation, appeared sporadically for short periods but was absent
      for the most part. Therefore most of this component together with the
      low-frequency component was also likely due to the baroreceptor-
      dependent peripheral modulation. The activity was sorted in 15
      subgroups on the basis of spike amplitudes in the RSNA. Each subgroup
      showed frequency characteristics similar to the whole nerve activity.
      These results suggest that all periodicity in the RSNA of conscious
      rats with intact baroreceptors is caused by the baroreceptor input.

N2  - Because granule cells in the dentate gyrus provide a major synaptic
      input to pyramidal neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus,
      spike generation by granule cells is likely to have a significant
      role in hippocampal information processing. Granule cells normally
      fire in a single-spike mode even when inhibition is blocked and
      provide single-spike output to CA3 when afferent activity converging
      into the entorhinal cortex from neocortex, brainstem, and other
      limbic regions increases. The effects of enhancement of N-methyl-D-
      aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent excitatory synaptic transmission
      and reduction in gamma -aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A)) receptor-
      dependent inhibition on spike generation were examined in granule
      cells of the dentate gyrus. In contrast to the single-spike mode
      observed in normal bathing conditions, perforant path stimulation in
      Mg2+-free bathing conditions evoked graded burst discharges in
      granule cells which increased in duration, amplitude, and number of
      spikes as a function of stimulus intensity. After burst discharges
      were evoked during transient exposure to bathing conditions that
      relieve the Mg2+ block of the NMDA receptor, there was a marked
      increase in the NMDA receptor-dependent component of the EPSP, but no
      significant increase in the non-NMDA receptor-dependent component of
      the EPSP in normal bathing medium. Supramaximal perforant path
      stimulation still evoked only a single spike, but granule cell spike
      generation was immediately converted from a single-spike firing mode
      to a graded burst discharge mode when inhibition was then reduced.
      The induction of graded burst discharges in Mg2+-free conditions and
      the expression of burst discharges evoked in normal bathing medium
      with subsequent disinhibition were both blocked by DL-2-amino-4-
      phosphonovaleric acid (APV) and were therefore NMDA receptor
      dependent, in contrast to long-term potentiation (LTP) in the
      perforant path, which is induced by NMDA receptors and is also
      expressed by alpha -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionate
      (AMPA) receptors. The graded burst discharge mode was also observed
      in granule cells when inhibition was reduced after a single epileptic
      afterdischarge, which enhances the NMDA receptor-dependent component
      of evoked synaptic response, and in the dentate gyrus reorganized by
      mossy fiber sprouting in kindled and kainic acid-treated rats. NMDA
      receptor-dependent plasticity of granule cell spike generation, which
      can be distinguished from LTP and induces long-term susceptibility to
      epileptic burst discharge under conditions of reduced inhibition,
      could modify information processing in the hippocampus and promote
      epileptic synchronization by increasing excitatory input into CA3.

N2  - The swimming lamprey normally maintains the dorsal-side-up
      orientation due to activity of the postural control system driven by
      vestibular organs. Commands for postural corrections are transmitted
      from the brain stem to the spinal cord mainly by the reticulospinal
      (RS) pathways. As shown in previous studies, RS neurons are activated
      by contralateral roll tilt, they exhibit a strong dynamic response,
      but much weaker static response. Here we test a hypothesis that
      decoding of these commands in the spinal cord is based on the
      subtraction of signals in the left and right RS pathways. In this
      study, we used a neuro-mechanical model. An intact lamprey was
      mounted on a platform that restrained its postural activity but
      allowed lateral locomotor undulations to occur. The activity in the
      left and right RS pathways was recorded by implanted electrodes.
      These natural biological signals were then used to control an
      electrical motor rotating the animal around its longitudinal axis
      toward the stronger signal. It was found that this "hybrid" system
      automatically stabilized a normal orientation of the lamprey in the
      gravitational field. The system compensated for large postural
      disturbances (lateral tilt up to +/-180 degrees) due to wide angular
      zones of the gravitational sensitivity of RS neurons. In the
      nonswimming lamprey, activity of RS neurons and their vestibular
      responses were considerably reduced, and the system was not able to
      stabilize the normal orientation. However, the balance could be
      restored by imposing small oscillations on the lamprey, which
      elicited additional activation of the vestibular organs. This finding
      indicates that head oscillations caused by locomotor movements may
      contribute to postural stabilization. In addition to postural
      stabilization, the neuro-mechanical model reproduced a number of
      postural effects characteristic of the lamprey: 1) unilateral eye
      illumination elicited a lateral tilt ("dorsal light response") due to
      a shift of the equilibrium point in the vestibular-driven postural
      network; 2) removal of one labyrinth resulted in a loss of postural
      control due to an induced left-right asymmetry in the vestibulo-
      reticulospinal reflexes, which 3) could be compensated for by
      asymmetrical visual input. The main conclusion of the present study
      is that natural supraspinal commands for postural corrections in the
      roll plane can be effectively decoded on the basis of subtraction of
      the effects of signals delivered by the left and right RS pathways.
      Possible mechanisms for this transformation are discussed.

U1  - Article
SP  - 2888

N2  - Cell lines derived from tumors engineered in the CNS offer promise as
      models of specific neuronal cell types. CAD cells are an unusual
      subclone of a murine cell line derived from tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
      driven tumorigenesis, which undergoes reversible morphological
      differentiation on serum deprivation. Using single-cell
      electrophysiology we have examined the properties of ion channels
      expressed in CAD cells. Despite relatively low resting potentials,
      CAD cells can be induced to fire robust action potentials when mildly
      artificially hyperpolarized. Correspondingly, voltage-dependent
      sodium and potassium currents were elicited under voltage clamp.
      Sodium currents are TTX sensitive and exhibit conventional activation
      and inactivation properties. The potassium currents reflected two
      pharmacologically distinguishable populations of delayed rectifier
      type channels while no transient A-type channels were observed. Using
      barium as a charge carrier, we observed an inactivating current that
      was completely blocked by nimodipine and thus associated with L-type
      calcium channels. On differentiation, three changes in functional
      channel expression occurred; a 4-fold decrease in sodium current
      density, a 1.5-fold increase in potassium current density, and the
      induction of a small noninactivating barium current component. The
      neuronal morphology, excitability properties, and changes in channel
      function with differentiation make CAD cells an attractive model for
      study of catecholaminergic neurons.

N2  - Neurons in the caudal hypothalamus (CH) are responsible for the
      modulation of various processes including respiratory and
      cardiovascular output. Previous results from this and other
      laboratories have demonstrated in vivo that these neurons have firing
      rhythms matched to the respiratory and cardiovascular cycles. The
      goal of the present study was to characterize the biophysical
      properties of neurons in the CH with particular emphasis in those
      properties responsible for rhythmic firing behavior. Whole cell,
      patch-clamped CH neurons displayed a resting membrane potential of +/-
      58.0 +/- 1.1 mV and an input resistance of 319.3 +/- 16.6 MV when
      recorded in current-clamp mode in an in vitro brain slice
      preparation. A large proportion of these neurons displayed
      postinhibitory rebound (PIR) that was dependent on the duration and
      magnitude of hyperpolarizing current as well as the resting membrane
      potential of the cell. Furthermore these neurons discharged tonically
      in response to a depolarizing current pulse at a depolarized resting
      membrane potential (more positive than -65 mV) but switched to a
      rapid burst of firing to the same stimulus when the resting membrane
      potential was lowered. The PIR observed in these neurons was calcium
      dependent as demonstrated by the ability to block its amplitude by
      perfusion of Ca2+-free bath solution or by application of Ni2+ (0.3-
      0.5 mM) or nifedipine (10 mM). These properties suggest that low-
      voltage- activated (LVA) calcium current is involved in the PIR and
      bursting firing of these CH neurons. In addition, high-voltage-
      activated calcium responses were detected after blockade of outward
      potassium current or in Ba2+-replacement solution. In addition,
      almost all of the CH neurons studied showed spike frequency
      adaptation that was decreased following Ca2+ removal, indicating the
      involvement of Ca2+-dependent K+ current (I-K,I-Ca)in these cells. In
      conclusion, CH neurons have at least two different types of calcium
      currents that contribute to their excitability; the dominant current
      is the LVA or T-type. This LVA current appears to play a significant
      role in the bursting characteristics that may underlie the rhythmic
      firing of CH neurons.

N2  - The vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) needs to modulate its gain depending
      on target distance to prevent retinal slip during head movements. We
      investigated gain modulation (context compensation) for binocular
      gaze stabilization in human subjects during voluntary yaw and pitch
      head rotations. Movements of each eye were recorded, both when
      attempting to maintain gaze on a small visual target at straight-
      ahead in a darkened room and after its disappearance (remembered
      target). In the analysis, we relied on a binocular coordinate system
      yielding a version and a vergence component. We examined how
      frequency and target distance, approached here by using vergence
      angle, affected the gain and phase of the version component of the
      VOR and compared the results to the requirements for ideal
      performance. Linear regression analysis on the version gain-vergence
      relationship yielded a slope representing the influence of target
      proximity and an intercept corresponding to the response at zero
      vergence ("default gain"). The slope of the fitted relationship,
      divided by the geometrically required slope, provided a measure for
      the quality of version context compensation ("context gain"). In both
      yaw and pitch experiments, we found default version gains close to
      one even for the remembered target condition, indicating that the
      active VOR for far targets is already close to ideal without visual
      support. In near target experiments, the presence of visual feedback
      yielded near unity context gains, indicating close to optimal
      performance (retinal slip <0.4<degrees>/s). For remembered targets,
      the context gain deteriorated but was still superior to performance
      in corresponding passive studies reported in the literature. In
      general, context compensation in the remembered target paradigm was
      better for vertical than for horizontal head rotations. The phase
      delay of version eye velocity relative to head velocity was small
      (similar to2 degrees) for both horizontal and vertical head
      movements. Analysis of the vergence data from the near target
      experiments showed that context compensation took into account that
      the two eyes require slightly different VORs. In the DISCUSSION,
      comparison of the present default VOR gains and context gains with
      data from earlier passive studies has led us to propose a limited
      role for efference copies during self-generated movements. We also
      discuss how our analysis can provide a framework for evaluating two
      different hypotheses for the generation of binocular VOR eye
      movements.

N2  - Limbic status epilepticus and preparation of hippocampal slice
      cultures both produce cell loss and denervation. This commonality led
      us to hypothesize that morphological and physiological alterations in
      hippocampal slice cultures may be similar to those observed in human
      limbic epilepsy and animal models. To test this hypothesis, we
      performed electrophysiological and morphological analyses in long-
      term (postnatal day 11; 40-60 days in vitro) organotypic hippocampal
      slice cultures. Electrophysiological analyses of dentate granule cell
      excitability revealed that granule cells in slice cultures were
      hyperexcitable compared with acute slices from normal rats. In
      physiological buffer, spontaneous electrographic granule cell
      seizures were seen in 22% of cultures; in the presence of a GABA(A)
      receptor antagonist, seizures were documented in 75% of cultures.
      Hilar stimulation evoked postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) and multiple
      population spikes in the granule cell layer, which were eliminated by
      glutamate receptor antagonists, demonstrating the requirement for
      excitatory synaptic transmission. By contrast, under identical
      recording conditions, acute hippocampal slices isolated from normal
      rats exhibited a lack of seizures, and hilar stimulation evoked an
      isolated population spike without PSPs. To examine the possibility
      that newly formed excitatory synaptic connections to the dentate
      gyrus contribute to granule cell hyperexcitability in slice cultures,
      anatomical labeling and electrophysiological recordings following
      knife cuts were performed. Anatomical labeling of individual dentate
      granule, CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells with neurobiotin illustrated the
      presence of axonal projections that may provide reciprocal excitatory
      synaptic connections among these regions and contribute to granule
      cell hyperexcitability. Knife cuts severing connections between CA1
      and the dentate gyrus/CA3c region reduced but did not abolish hilar-
      evoked excitatory PSPs, suggesting the presence of newly formed,
      functional synaptic connections to the granule cells from CA1 and CA3
      as well as from neurons intrinsic to the dentate gyrus. Many of the
      electrophysiological and morphological abnormalities reported here
      for long-term hippocampal slice cultures bear striking similarities
      to both human and in vivo models, making this in vitro model a
      simple, powerful system to begin to elucidate the molecular and
      cellular mechanisms underlying synaptic rearrangements and
      epileptogenesis.

N2  - The biophysical and pharmacological properties of voltage-gated
      calcium channel currents in the human teratocarcinoma cell line NT2-N
      were studied using the whole cell patch-clamp technique. When held at
      -80 mV, barium currents (I(Ba)s) were evoked by voltage commands to
      above -35 mV that peaked at +5 mV. When holding potentials were
      reduced to -20 mV or 5 mM barium was substituted for 5 mM calcium,
      there was a reduction in peak currents and a right shift in the
      current-voltage curve. A steady-state inactivation curve for I-Ba was
      fit with a Boltzmann curve (V-1/2 = -43.3 mV; slope = -17.7 mV).
      Maximal current amplitude increased from 1-wk (232 pA) to 9-wk (1025
      pA) postdifferentiation. Whole cell I(Ba)s were partially blocked by
      specific channel blockers to a similar extent in 1- to 3-wk and 7- to
      9-wk postdifferentiation NT2-N cells: 10 muM nifedipine (19 vs. 25%),
      10 muM conotoxin GVIA (27 vs. 25%), 10 muM conotoxin MVIIC (15 vs.
      16%), and 1.75 muM SNX-482 (31 vs. 33%). Currents were completely
      blocked by 300 muM cadmium. In the presence of nifedipine, GVIA, and
      MVIIC, similar to 35% of current remained, which was reduced further
      by SNX-482 (7-14% of current remained), consistent with functional
      expression of L-, N-, and P/Q-calcium channel types and one or more R-
      type channel. The presence of multiple calcium currents in this human
      neuronal-type cell line provides a potentially useful model for study
      of the regulation, expression and cellular function of human derived
      calcium channel currents; in particular the R-type current(s).

N2  - We followed simple- and complex-spike firing of Purkinje cells (PCs)
      in the floccular complex of the cerebellum through learned
      modifications of the pursuit eye movements of two monkeys. Learning
      was induced by double steps of target speed in which initially
      stationary targets move at a "learning" speed for 100 ms and then
      change to either a higher or lower speed in the same direction. In
      randomly interleaved control trials, targets moved at the learning
      speed in the opposite direction. When the learning direction was the
      ON direction for simple- spike responses, learning was associated
      with statistically significant changes in simple- spike firing for 10
      of 32 PCs. Of the 10 PCs that showed significant expressions of
      learning, 8 showed changes in simple-spike output in the expected
      direction: increased or decreased firing when eye acceleration
      increased or decreased through learning. There were no statistically
      significant changes in simple- spike responses or eye acceleration
      during pursuit in the control direction. When the learning direction
      was in the OFF direction for simple- spike responses, none of 15 PCs
      showed significant correlates of learning. Although changes in simple-
      spike firing were recorded in only a subset of PCs, analysis of the
      population response showed that the same relationship between
      population firing and eye acceleration obtained before and after
      learning. Thus learning is associated with changes that render the
      modified population response appropriate to drive the changed
      behavior. To analyze complex-spike firing during learning we
      correlated complex-spike firing in the second, third, and fourth 100
      ms after the onset of target motion with the retinal image motion in
      the previous 100 ms. Data were largely consistent with previous
      evidence that image motion drives complex spikes with a direction
      selectivity opposite that for simple spikes. Comparison of complex-
      spike responses at different times after the onset of control and
      learning target motions in the learning direction implied that
      complex spikes could guide learning during decreases but not
      increases in eye acceleration. Learning caused increases or decreases
      in the sensitivity of complex spikes to image motion in parallel with
      changes in eye acceleration. Complex-spike responses were similar in
      all PCs, including many in which learning did not modify simple-
      spike responses. Our data do not disprove current theories of
      cerebellar learning but suggest that these theories would have to be
      modified to account for simple- and complex-spike firing of floccular
      Purkinje cells reported here.

N2  - In the sea slug Aplysia, rhythmic biting is eliminated after
      bilateral cerebral-buccal connective (CBC) crushes and recovers
      within 14 days postlesion (dpl). The ability of cerebral-buccal
      interneuron-2 (CBI-2) to elicit ingestion buccal motor programs
      (iBMPs; i.e., fictive rhythmic ingestion) and to regenerate synaptic
      connections with target buccal neurons was assessed with
      intracellular recordings and dye injections. Isolated central ganglia
      were obtained from control animals and from lesioned animals at
      selected times after bilateral CBC crushes. Within 3 wk postlesion,
      transected CBI-2 axons sprouted at least 10 fine neurites confined to
      the core of the CBC that projected across the crush site toward the
      buccal ganglia. When fired with depolarizing current steps, CBI-2 was
      not observed to elicit iBMPs in preparations until 14 dpl. Thereafter
      a progressive enhancement in CBI-2's ability to elicit iBMPs was
      observed with time postlesion. By 40 dpl, CBI-2-elicited iBMPs were
      indistinguishable from those of controls. CBI-2 regenerated
      monosynaptic connections with appropriate buccal premotor- and
      motorneurons by 14 dpl, and the strength of these connections
      increased with time postlesion. Dramatic frequency facilitation was
      exhibited by the regenerating CBI-2 buccal synapses; for instance, at
      early postlesion times, no observable excitatory postsynaptic
      potentials (EPSPs) were obtained with 1- Hz stimulation of CBI-2,
      while at 7 Hz, a dramatic increase in EPSP amplitude was obtained
      with successive spikes. The present study shows that the time course
      of axonal and synaptic regeneration by command-like interneuron CBI-2
      is correlated with the recovery of ingestion buccal motor programs
      elicited by CBI-2. These results parallel our previous findings of
      functional neural regeneration in the feeding system and suggest that
      functional neural regeneration is at least in part mediated by
      regeneration of specific synaptic pathways.

N2  - Whole cell voltage-clamp recordings of freshly isolated cells were
      used to study changes in the currents through voltage-gated Ca2+
      channels during the post-natal development of immature radial glial
      cells into Muller cells of the rabbit retina. Using Ba2+ or Ca2+ ions
      as charge carriers, currents through transient low-voltage-activated
      (LVA) Ca2+ channels were recorded in cells from early postnatal
      stages, with an activation threshold at -60 mV and a peak current at -
      25 mV. To increase the amplitude of currents through Ca2+ channels,
      Na+ ions were used as the main charge carriers, and currents were
      recorded in divalent cation-free bath solutions. Currents through
      transient LVA Ca2+ channels were found in all radial glial cells from
      retinae between postnatal days 2 and 37. The currents activated at
      potentials positive to -80 mV and displayed a maximum at -40 mV. The
      amplitude of LVA currents increased during the first postnatal week;
      after postnatal day 6, the amplitude remained virtually constant. The
      density of LVA currents was highest at early postnatal days (days 2-
      5: 13 pA/pF) and decreased to a stable, moderate level within the
      first three postnatal weeks (3 pA/pF). A significant expression of
      currents through sustained, high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels was
      found after the third postnatal week in similar to 25% of the
      investigated cells. The early and sole expression of transient
      currents at high-density may suggest that LVA Ca2+ channels are
      involved in early developmental processes of rabbit Muller cells.

N2  - Most objects that we manipulate have curved surfaces. We have
      analyzed how subjects during a prototypical manipulatory task use
      visual and tactile sensory information for adapting fingertip actions
      to changes in object curvature. Subjects grasped an elongated object
      at one end using a precision grip and lifted it while instructed to
      keep it level. The principal load of the grasp was tangential torque
      due to the location of the center of mass of the object in relation
      to the horizontal grip axis joining the centers of the opposing grasp
      surfaces. The curvature strongly influenced the grip forces required
      to prevent rotational slips. Likewise the curvature influenced the
      rotational yield of the grasp that developed under the tangential
      torque load due to the viscoelastic properties of the fingertip
      pulps. Subjects scaled the grip forces parametrically with object
      curvature for grasp stability. Moreover in a curvature-dependent
      manner, subjects twisted the grasp around the grip axis by a radial
      flexion of the wrist to keep the desired object orientation despite
      the rotational yield. To adapt these fingertip actions to object
      curvature, subjects could use both vision and tactile sensibility
      integrated with predictive control. During combined blindfolding and
      digital anesthesia, however, the motor output failed to predict the
      consequences of the prevailing curvature. Subjects used vision to
      identify the curvature for efficient feedforward retrieval of grip
      force requirements before executing the motor commands. Digital
      anesthesia caused little impairment of grip force control when
      subjects had vision available, but the adaptation of the twist became
      delayed. Visual cues about the form of the grasp surface obtained
      before contact was used to scale the grip force, whereas the scaling
      of the twist depended on visual cues related to object movement. Thus
      subjects apparently relied on different visuomotor mechanisms for
      adaptation of grip force and grasp kinematics. In contrast,
      blindfolded subjects used tactile cues about the prevailing curvature
      obtained after contact with the object for feedforward adaptation of
      both grip force and twist. We conclude that humans use both vision
      and tactile sensibility for feedforward parametric adaptation of grip
      forces and grasp kinematics to object curvature. Normal control of
      the twist action, however, requires digital afferent input, and
      different visuomotor mechanisms support the control of the grasp
      twist and the grip force. This differential use of vision may have a
      bearing to the two-stream model of human visual processing.

N2  - The heterogeneous family of G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate
      receptors (mGluRs) provides excitatory and inhibitory controls of
      synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability in the nervous
      system. Eight mGluR subtypes have been cloned and are classified in
      three subgroups. Group I mGluRs can stimulate phosphoinositide
      hydrolysis and activate protein kinase C whereas group II (mGluR2 and
      3) and group III (mGluR4, 6, 7, and 8) mGluRs share the ability to
      inhibit cAMP formation. The present study examined the roles of
      groups II and III mGluRs in the processing of brief nociceptive
      information and capsaicin-induced central sensitization of primate
      spinothalamic tract (STT) cells in vivo. In 11 anesthetized male
      monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), extracellular recordings were made
      from 21 STT cells in the lumbar dorsal horn. Responses to brief (15
      s) cutaneous stimuli of innocuous (brush), marginally and distinctly
      noxious (press and pinch, respectively) intensity were recorded
      before, during, and after the infusion of group II and group III
      mGluR agonists into the dorsal horn by microdialysis. Different
      concentrations were applied for at least 20 min each (at 5 mul/min)
      to obtain cumulative concentration-response relationships. Values in
      this paper refer to the drug concentrations in the microdialysis
      fibers; actual concentrations in the tissue are about three orders of
      magnitude lower. The agonists were also applied at 10-25 min after
      intradermal capsaicin injection. The group II agonists (2S, 1'S,2'S)-
      2-(carboxycyclopropyl) glycine (LCCG1, 1 muM-10 mM, n = 6) and (2)-2-
      oxa-4-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-4,6-dicarboxylate (LY379268; 1 muM-10
      mM, n 5 6) had no significant effects on the responses to brief
      cutaneous mechanical stimuli (brush, press, pinch) or on ongoing
      background activity. In contrast, the group III agonist L(+)-2-amino-
      4-phosphonobutyric acid (LAP4, 0.1 muM-10 mM, n 5 6) inhibited the
      responses to cutaneous mechanical stimuli in a concentration-
      dependent manner, having a stronger effect on brush responses than on
      responses to press and pinch. LAP4 did not change background
      discharges significantly. Intradermal injections of capsaicin
      increased ongoing background activity and sensitized the STT cells to
      cutaneous mechanical stimuli (ongoing activity > brush. press.
      pinch). When given as posttreatment, the group II agonists LCCG1 (100
      muM, n = 5) and LY379268 (100 muM, n 5 6) and the group III agonist
      LAP4 (100 muM, n = 6) reversed the capsaicin-induced sensitization.
      After washout of the agonists, the central sensitization resumed. Our
      data suggest that, while activation of both group II and group III
      mGluRs can reverse capsaicin-induced central sensitization, it is the
      actions of group II mGluRs in particular that undergo significant
      functional changes during central sensitization because they modulate
      responses of sensitized STT cells but have no effect under control
      conditions.

N2  - In central neurons, the summation of inputs from presynaptic cells
      combined with the unreliability of synaptic transmission produces
      incessant variations of the membrane potential termed synaptic noise
      (SN). These fluctuations, which depend on both the unpredictable
      timing of afferent activities and quantal variations of postsynaptic
      potentials, have defied conventional analysis. We show here that,
      when applied to SN recorded from the Mauthner (M) cell of teleosts, a
      simple method of nonlinear analysis reveals previously undetected
      features of this signal including hidden periodic components. The
      phase relationship between these components is compatible with the
      notion that the temporal organization of events comprising this noise
      is deterministic rather than random and that it is generated by
      presynaptic interneurons behaving as coupled periodic oscillators.
      Furthermore a model of the presynaptic network shows how SN is shaped
      both by activities in incoming inputs and by the distribution of
      their synaptic weights expressed as mean quantal contents of the
      activated synapses. In confirmation we found experimentally that long-
      term tetanic potentiation (LTP), which selectively increases some of
      these synaptic weights, permits oscillating temporal patterns to be
      transmitted more effectively to the postsynaptic cell. Thus the
      probabilistic nature of transmitter release, which governs the
      strength of synapses, may be critical for the transfer of complex
      timing information within neuronal assemblies.

N2  - We have studied a simple form of motor learning in the human brain so
      as to isolate activity related to motor learning and the prediction
      of sensory events. Whole-brain, event-related functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to record activity during classical
      discriminative delay eyeblink conditioning. Auditory conditioned
      stimulus (CS+) trials were presented either with a corneal airpuff
      unconditioned stimulus (US, paired), or without a US (unpaired).
      Auditory CS- trials were never reinforced with a US. Trials were
      presented pseudorandomly, 66 times each. The subjects gradually
      produced conditioned responses to CS+ trials, while increasingly
      differentiating between CS+ and CS- trials. The increasing difference
      between hemodynamic responses for unpaired CS+ and for CS- trials
      evolved slowly during conditioning in the ipsilateral cerebellar
      cortex (Crus I/Lobule HVI), contralateral motor cortex and
      hippocampus. To localize changes that were related to sensory
      prediction, we compared trials on which the expected airpuff US
      failed to occur (Unpaired CS+) with trials on which it occurred as
      expected (Paired CS+). Error-related signals in the contralateral
      cerebellum and somatosensory cortex were seen to increase during
      learning as the sensory prediction became stronger. The changes seen
      in the ipsilateral cerebellar cortex may be due either to the
      violations of sensory predictions, or to learning-related increases
      in the excitability of cerebellar neurons to presentations of the CS+.

T1  - Comparison of odor receptive field plasticity in the rat olfactory
      bulb and anterior piriform cortex
AU  - Wilson,D.A.
U1  - Article
SP  - 3036
EP  - 3042
N2  - Recent work in the anterior piriform cortex (aPCX) has demonstrated
      that cortical odor receptive fields are highly dynamic, showing rapid
      changes of both firing rate and temporal patterning within relatively
      few inhalations of an odor, despite relatively maintained, patterned
      input from olfactory bulb mitral/tufted cells. The present experiment
      examined the precision (odor-specificity) of this receptive field
      plasticity and compared it with the primary cortical afferent,
      olfactory bulb mitral/tufted cells. Adult Long-Evans hooded rats,
      urethan anesthetized and freely breathing, were used for single-unit
      recording from mitral/tufted and aPCX layer II/III neurons. Partial
      mapping of receptive fields to alkane odors (pentane, heptane, and
      nonane) was performed before and immediately after habituation (50-s
      exposure) to one of the alkanes. The results demonstrated that odor
      habituation of aPCX responses was odor specific, with minimal cross-
      habituation between alkanes differing by as few as two carbons.
      Mitral/tufted cells, however, showed strong cross-habituation within
      the odor set with the most profound cross effects to carbon chains
      shorter than the habituating stimulus. The results suggest that
      although mitral/tufted cells and aPCX neurons have roughly similar
      odor receptive fields, aPCX neurons have significantly better odor
      discrimination within their receptive field. The results have
      important implications for understanding the underlying bases of
      receptive fields in olfactory system neurons and the mechanisms of
      odor discrimination and memory.

T1  - Convergence of multimodal sensory input onto higher-level neurons of
      the crayfish olfactory pathway
AU  - Mellon,D. Jr.
U1  - Article
SP  - 3043
EP  - 3055
N2  - Intracellular electrophysiological studies of lateral protocerebral
      interneurons (LPIs) in the crayfish Procambarus clarkii have revealed
      convergence of multimodal sensory information onto these higher-level
      cells of the crustacean central olfactory pathway. Antennular
      stimulation by odors or electrical shocks generates excitatory-
      inhibitory sequences in some LPIs as does electrical or hydrodynamic
      stimulation of the antennae. Photic stimulation of the ipsilateral
      compound eye generates excitatory responses in LPIs, usually in the
      form of trains of impulse bursts that are timed to the peaks of the
      spontaneous oscillatory activity that characterizes these neurons.
      Focal electrical stimulation of the olfactory lobe, the termination
      point of antennular afferent input, or the accessory lobe, where
      higher-level visual and tactile inputs converge, also generates brief
      excitation and a delayed, prolonged inhibition in LPIs. Both phases
      of this activity are thought to be transmitted to the lateral
      protocerebrum via deutocerebral projection neurons, which have
      extensive dendritic arborizations in the olfactory lobe and the
      accessory lobe. The excitatory pathway is thought to synapse directly
      with target LPIs, whereas the inhibitory pathway is probably indirect
      and mediated through GABAergic interneurons within the lateral
      protocerebrum. There is evidence that both presynaptic and
      postsynaptic inhibition suppress activity in LPIs. Preliminary
      observations suggest that a small cluster of neurons adjacent to the
      hemi-ellipsoid body are inhibitory to LPI activity. Multimodal

      in the contextual identification of odors in the crayfish olfactory
      system.

N2  - Although most of the characterized insect neuropeptides have been
      detected by their actions on muscle contractions, not much is known
      about the mechanisms underlying excitation-contraction coupling. Thus
      we initiated a pharmacological study on the myotropic action of the
      peptides periviscerokinin-2 (PVK-2) and proctolin on the hyperneural
      muscle of the cockroach Periplaneta americana. Both peptides required
      extracellular Ca2+ to induce muscle contraction, and a blockage of
      sarcolemmal Ca2+ channels by Mn2+ or La3+ inhibited myotropic
      effects. The peptides were able to induce contractions in dependence
      on the extracellular Ca2+ concentration in muscles depolarized with
      high K+ saline. A reduction of extracellular Na+, K+,or Cl- did not
      effect peptide action. Nifedipine, an L-type Ca2+-channel blocker,
      partially blocked the response to both peptides but to a much lesser
      extent than contractions evoked by elevated K+. Using calcium imaging
      with fluo-3, we show that proctolin induces an increase of the
      intracellular Ca2+ concentration. In calcium-free saline, no increase
      of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration could be detected. The
      inhibiting effect of ryanodine, thapsigargin, and TMB-8 on peptide-
      induced contractions suggests that Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic
      reticulum plays a major role during peptide-induced contractions.
      Preliminary experiments suggest that the peptides do not employ
      cyclic nucleotides as second messengers, but may activate protein
      kinase C. Our results indicate that the peptides induce Ca2+ influx
      by an activation or modulation of dihydropyridine-sensitive and
      voltage-independent sarcolemmal Ca2+ channels. Ca2+-induced Ca2+
      release from intracellular stores, but not inositol trisphosphate-
      induced Ca2+ release, seems to account for most of the observed
      increase in intracellular Ca2+. Additionally, both peptides were able
      to potentiate glutamate-induced contractions at threshold
      concentrations.

N2  - We determined whether head position with regard to gravity is an
      important context for angular vestibuloocular reflex (aVOR) gain
      adaptation. Vertical aVOR gains were adapted with monkeys upright or
      on side by rotating the animals about an interaural axis in phase or
      out of phase with the visual surround for 4 h. When aVOR gains were
      adapted with monkeys upright, gain changes were symmetrical when
      tested in either on-side position (23 +/- 7%; mean +/- SD). After on-
      side adaptation, however, gain changes were always larger when
      animals were tested in the same on-side position in which they were
      adapted. Gain changes were 43 +/- 16% with ipsilateral side down and
      9 +/- 8% with contralateral side down. The context-specific effects
      of head position on vertical aVOR gain were the same whether the gain
      was increased or decreased. The data indicate that vertical aVOR gain
      changes are stored in the context of the head orientation in which
      changes were induced. This association could be an important context
      for expressing the adapted state of the aVOR gain during vertical
      head movement.

N2  - Research suggests that the basal ganglia complex is a major component
      of the neural circuitry that mediates reward-related processing.
      However, human studies have not yet characterized the response of the
      basal ganglia to an isolated reward, as has been done in animals. We
      developed an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
      paradigm to identify brain areas that are activated after
      presentation of a reward. Subjects guessed whether the value of a
      card was higher or lower than the number 5, with monetary rewards as
      an incentive for correct guesses. They received reward, punishment,
      or neutral feedback on different trials. Regions in the dorsal and
      ventral striatum were activated by the paradigm, showing differential
      responses to reward and punishment. Activation was sustained
      following a reward feedback, but decreased below baseline following a
      punishment feedback.

N2  - We have previously shown that there is a slowly progressing,
      frequency-specific recovery of the gain and phase of the horizontal
      vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) in rhesus monkeys following plugging of
      the lateral semicircular canals. The adapted VOR response exhibited
      both dynamic and spatial characteristics that were distinctly
      different from responses in intact animals. To discriminate between
      adaptation or recovery of central versus peripheral origin, we have
      tested the recovered vestibuloocular responses in three rhesus
      monkeys in which either one or both coplanar pairs of vertical
      semicircular canals had been plugged previously by occluding the
      remaining semicircular canals in a second plugging operation. We
      measured the spatial tuning of the VOR in two or three different
      mutually orthogonal planes in response to sinusoidal oscillations
      (1.1 Hz, +/-5 degrees, +/-35 degrees /s) over a period of 2-3 and 12-
      14 mo after each operation. Apart from a significant recovery of the
      torsional/vertical VOR following the first operation we found that
      these recovered responses were preserved following the second
      operation, whereas the responses from the newly operated semicircular
      canals disappeared acutely as expected. In the follow-up period of up
      to 3 mo after the second operation, responses from the last operated
      canals showed recovery in two of three animals, whereas the
      previously recovered responses persisted. The results suggest that
      VOR recovery following plugging may depend on a regained residual
      sensitivity of the plugged semicircular canals to angular head
      acceleration.

N2  - Recent studies show that the auditory corticofugal system modulates
      and improves ongoing signal processing and reorganizes frequency map
      according to auditory experience in the central nucleus of bat
      inferior colliculus. However, whether all corticofugally affected
      collicular neurons are involved in both types of modulation has not
      been determined. In this study, we demonstrate that one group (51%)
      of collicular neurons participates only in corticofugal modulation of
      ongoing signal processing, while a second group (49%) of collicular
      neurons participates in both modulation of ongoing signal processing
      and in reorganization of the auditory system.

T1  - Seizures induce simultaneous GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission
      in the dentate Gyrus-CA3 system
AU  - Gutierrez,R.
U1  - Article
SP  - 3088
EP  - 3090
N2  - Monosynaptic and polysynaptic responses of CA3 pyramidal cells (PC)
      to stimulation of the dentate gyrus (DG) are normally blocked by
      glutamate receptor antagonists (GluRAs). However, after kindled
      seizures, GluRAs block the monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic
      potential (EPSP) and isolate a monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic
      potential (IPSP), suggesting that mossy fibers release GABA. However,
      kindling epilepsy induces neuronal sprouting, which can underlie this
      fast inhibitory response. To explore this possibility, the synaptic
      responses of PC to DG stimulation were analyzed in kindled epileptic
      rats, with and without seizures, and in nonepileptic rats,
      immediately after a single pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure,
      in which sprouting is unlikely to have occurred. Excitatory and
      inhibitory synaptic responses of PC to DG stimulation were blocked by
      GluRAs in control cells and in cells from kindled nonseizing rats,
      confirming that inhibitory potentials are disynaptically mediated.
      However, a fast IPSP could be evoked in kindled epileptic rats and in
      nonepileptic rats after a single PTZ-induced seizure. The same
      response was induced after rekindling the epileptic nonseizing rats.
      This IPSP has an onset latency that parallels that of the control
      EPSP and is not altered under low Ca2+ medium or halothane perfusion.
      In addition, it was reversibly depressed by L(+)-2- amino-4-
      phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4), which is known to inhibit transmitter
      release from mossy fibers. These results demonstrate that seizures,
      and not the synaptic rearrangement due to an underlying epileptic
      state, induce the emergence of fast inhibition in the DG-CA3 system,
      and suggest that the mossy fibers underlie this plastic change.
