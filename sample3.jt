N2  - The origin of granites was once a question solely for petrologists
      and geochemists. But in recent years a consensus has emerged that
      recognizes the essential role of deformation in the segregation,
      transport and emplacement of silica-rich melts in the continental
      crust. Accepted petrological models are being questioned, either
      because they require unrealistic rheological behaviours of rocks and
      magmas, or because they do not satisfactorily explain the available
      structural or geophysical data. Provided flow is continuous,
      mechanical considerations suggest that-far from being geologically
      sluggish-granite magmatism is a rapid, dynamic process operating at
      timescales of less than or equal to 100,000 years, irrespective of
      tectonic setting.

N2  - Giant tsunamis, generated by submarine landslides in the Hawaiian
      Islands, have been thought to be responsible for the deposition of
      chaotic gravels high on the southern coastal slopes of the islands of
      Lana'i and Moloka'i, Hawaii. Here we investigate this hypothesis,
      using uranium-thorium dating of the Hulopoe gravel (on Lana'i) and a
      study of stratigraphic relationships, such as facies changes and
      hiatuses, within the deposit. The Hulopoe gravel contains corals of
      two age groups, representing marine isotope stages be and 7 (similar
      to 135,000 and 240,000 years ago, respectively), with significant
      geographical and stratigraphic ordering. We show that the Hulopoe
      gravel was formed by multiple depositional events, separated by
      considerable periods of time, thus invalidating the main premise of
      the 'giant wave' hypothesis. Instead, the gravels were probably
      deposited during interglacial periods (when sea level was relatively
      high) by typical Hawaiian shoreline processes such as seasonal wave
      patterns, storm events and possibly 'normal' tsunamis, and reached
      their present height by uplift: of Lana'i.

N2  - The principal guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho family G
      proteins contain tandem Dbl-homology (DH) and pleckstrin-homology
      (PH) domains that catalyse nucleotide exchange and the activation of
      G proteins. Here we have determined the crystal structure of the DH
      and PH domains of the T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis factor 1
      (Tiam1) protein in complex with its cognate Rho family G protein,
      Rac1. The two switch regions of Rac1 are stabilized in conformations
      that disrupt both magnesium binding and guanine nucleotide
      interaction. The resulting cleft in Rac1 is devoid of nucleotide and
      highly exposed to solvent. The PH domain of Tiam1 does not contact
      Rac1, and the position and orientation of the PH domain is markedly
      altered relative to the structure of the uncomplexed, GTPase-free
      DH/PH element from Sos1. The Tiam1/Rac1 structure highlights the
      interactions that catalyse nucleotide exchange on Rho family G
      proteins, and illustrates structural determinants dictating
      specificity between individual Rho family members and their
      associated Dbl-related guanine nucleotide exchange factors.

T1  - An optical counterpart to the anomalous X-ray pulsar 4U0142+61

N2  - The energy source of the anomalous X-ray pulsars' (AXPs) is not
      understood, hence their designation as anomalous. Unlike binary X-ray
      pulsars, no companions are seen, so the energy cannot be supplied by
      accretion of matter from a companion star. The loss of rotational
      energy, which powers radio pulsars, is insufficient to power AXPs.
      Two models are generally considered: accretion from a large disk left
      over from the birth process(2,3), or decay of a very strong magnetic
      field (10(15) G) associated with a 'magnetar'(4). The lack of
      counterparts at other wavelengths has hampered progress in our
      understanding of these objects. Here we report deep optical
      observations of the field around 4U0142+61, which is the brightest
      AXP in X-rays. The source has no associated supernova remnant, which,
      together with its spin-down timescale of similar to 10(5)yr (ref. 5),
      suggests that it may be relatively old. We find an object with
      peculiar optical colours at the position of the X-ray source, and
      argue that it is the optical counterpart. The optical emission is too
      faint to admit the presence of a large accretion disk, but may be
      consistent with magnetospheric emission from a magnetar.

N2  - Quantum theory predicts that Bose-Einstein condensation of a
      spatially homogeneous gas with attractive interactions is precluded
      by a conventional phase transition into either a liquid or solid(1).
      When confined to a trap, however, such a condensate can form(2),
      provided that its occupation number does not exceed a limiting
      value(3,4). The stability limit is determined by a balance between
      the self-attractive fortes and a repulsion that arises from position-
      momentum uncertainty under conditions of spatial confinement. Near
      the stability limit, self-attraction can overwhelm the repulsion,
      causing the condensate to collapse(5-8). Growth of the condensate is
      therefore punctuated by intermittent collapses(9,10) that are
      triggered by either macroscopic quantum tunnelling or thermal
      fluctuation. Previous observations of growth and collapse dynamics
      have been hampered by the stochastic nature of these mechanisms. Here
      we report direct observations of the growth and subsequent collapse
      of a Li-7 condensate with attractive interactions, using phase-
      contrast imaging. The success of the measurement lies in our ability
      to reduce the stochasticity in the dynamics by controlling the
      initial number of condensate atoms using a two-photon transition to a
      diatomic molecular state.

N2  - The increasingly sluggish response of a supercooled liquid as it
      nears its glass transition(1) (for example, refrigerated honey) is
      prototypical of glassy dynamics found in proteins, neural networks
      and superconductors. The notion that molecules rearrange
      cooperatively has long been postulated(2) to explain diverging
      relaxation times and broadened (non-exponential) response functions
      near the glass transition. Recently, cooperativity was observed and
      analysed in colloid glasses(3) and in simulations of binary liquids
      well above the glass transition(4). But nanometre-scale studies of
      cooperativity at the molecular glass transition are lacking(5).
      Important issues to be resolved include the precise form of the
      cooperativity and its length scale(6), and whether the broadened
      response is intrinsic to individual cooperative regions, or arises
      only from heterogeneity(7-9) in an ensemble of such regions. Here we
      describe direct observations of molecular cooperativity near the
      glass transition in polyvinylacetate (PVAc), using nanometre-scale
      probing of dielectric fluctuations. Molecular dusters switched
      spontaneously among two to four distinct configurations, producing
      random telegraph noise. Our analysis of these noise signals and their
      power spectra reveals that individual dusters exhibit transient
      dynamical heterogeneity and non-exponential kinetics.

N2  - Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are believed to drive
      climate changes from glacial to interglacial modes', although
      geological(1-3) and astronomical(4-6) mechanisms have been invoked as
      ultimate causes. Additionally, it is unclear(7,8) whether the changes
      between cold and warm modes should be regarded as a global
      phenomenon, affecting tropical and high-latitude temperatures alike(9-
      13), or if they are better described as an expansion and contraction
      of the latitudinal climate zones, keeping equatorial temperatures
      approximately constant(14-16). Here we present a reconstruction of
      tropical sea surface temperatures throughout the phanerozoic eon (the
      past similar to 550 Myr) from our database(17) of oxygen isotopes in
      calcite and aragonite shells. The data indicate large oscillations of
      tropical sea surface temperatures in phase with the cold-warm cycles,
      thus favouring the idea of climate variability as a global
      phenomenon. But our data conflict with a temperature reconstruction
      using an energy balance model that is forced by reconstructed
      atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations(18). The results can be
      reconciled if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were not the
      principal driver of climate variability on geological timescales for
      at least one-third of the Phanerozoic eon, or if the reconstructed
      carbon dioxide concentrations are not reliable.

N2  - Up to 10 per cent of the ocean floor consists of plateaux(1)-regions
      of unusually thick oceanic crust thought to be formed by the heads of
      mantle plumes. Given the ubiquitous presence of recycled oceanic
      crust in the mantle source of hotspot basalts, it follows that
      plateau material should also be an important mantle constituent. Here
      we show that the geochemistry of the Pleistocene basalts from
      Logudoro, Sardinia, is compatible with the remelting of ancient ocean
      plateau material that has been recycled into the mantle. The Sr, Nd
      and Hf isotope compositions of these basalts do not show the
      signature of pelagic sediments. The basalts' low CaO/Al2O3 and Ce/Pb
      ratios, their unradiogenic Pb-206 and Pb-208, and their Sr, Ba, Eu
      and Pb excesses indicate that their mantle source contains ancient
      gabbros formed initially by plagioclase accumulation, typical of
      plateau material. Also, the high Th/U ratios of the mantle source
      resemble those of plume magmas. Geochemically, the Logudoro basalts
      resemble those from Pitcairn Island, which contain the controversial
      EM-1 component that has been interpreted as arising from a mantle
      source sprinkled with remains of pelagic sediments(2,3). We argue,
      instead, that the EM-1 source from these two localities is
      essentially free of sedimentary material, the geochemical
      characteristics of these lavas being better explained by the presence
      of recycled oceanic plateaux. The storage of plume heads in the deep
      mantle through time offers a convenient explanation for the
      persistence of chemical and mineralogical layering in the mantle.

N2  - Non-avian dinosaurs are mostly medium to large-sized animals, and to
      date all known mature specimens are larger than the most primitive
      bird, Archaeopteryx(1). Here we report on a new dromaeosaurid
      dinosaur, Microraptor zhaoianus gen. et sp. nov., from the Early
      Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning, China(2). This is the
      first mature non-avian dinosaur to be found that is smaller than
      Archaeopteryx(1), and it eliminates the size disparity between the
      earliest birds and their closest non-avian theropod relatives. The
      more bird-like teeth, the Rahonavis-like ischium and the small number
      of caudal vertebrae of Microraptor are unique among dromaeosaurids
      and improve our understanding of the morphological transition to
      birds. The nearly completely articulated foot shows features, such as
      distally positioned digit I, slender and recurved pedal claws, and
      elongated penultimate phalanges, that are comparable to those of
      arboreal birds(3-6). The discovery of these in non-avian theropods
      provides new insights for studying the palaeoecology of some bird-
      like theropod dinosaurs.

N2  - The analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been a potent tool in
      our understanding of human evolution, owing to characteristics such
      as high copy number, apparent lack of recombination(1), high
      substitution rate(2) and maternal mode of inheritance(3). However,
      almost all studies of human evolution based on mtDNA sequencing have
      been confined to the control region, which constitutes less than 7%
      of the mitochondrial genome. These studies are complicated by the
      extreme variation in substitution rate between sites, and the
      consequence of parallel mutations(4) causing difficulties in the
      estimation of genetic distance and making phylogenetic inferences
      questionable(5). Most comprehensive studies of the human
      mitochondrial molecule have been carried out through restriction-
      fragment length polymorphism analysis(6), providing data that are ill
      suited to estimations of mutation rate and therefore the timing of
      evolutionary events. Here, to improve the information obtained from
      the mitochondrial molecule for studies of human evolution, We
      describe the global mtDNA diversity in humans based on analyses of
      the complete mtDNA sequence of 53 humans of diverse origins. Our
      mtDNA data, in comparison with those of a parallel study of the
      Xq13.3 region(7) in the same individuals, provide a concurrent view
      on human evolution with respect to the age of modern humans.

N2  - Stomatal pores on the leaf surface control both the uptake of CO2 for
      photosynthesis and the loss of water during transpiration. Since the
      industrial revolution, decreases in stomatal numbers in parallel with
      increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration have provided evidence of
      plant responses to changes in CO2 levels caused by human
      activity(1,2). This inverse correlation between stomatal density and
      CO2 concentration also holds for fossil material from the past 400
      million years(3) and has provided dues to the causes of global
      extinction events(4). Here we report the identification of the
      Arabidopsis gene HIC (for high carbon dioxide), which encodes a
      negative regulator of stomatal development that responds to CO2
      concentration. This gene encodes a putative 3-keto acyl coenzyme A
      synthase-an enzyme involved in the synthesis of very-long-chain fatty
      acids(5). Mutant hic plants exhibit up to a 42% increase in stomatal
      density in response to a doubling of CO2. Our results identify a gene
      involved in the signal transduction pathway responsible for
      controlling stomatal numbers at elevated CO2.

N2  - The circadian system regulates 24-hour biological rhythms' and
      seasonal rhythms, such as flowering(2). Long-day flowering plants
      like Arabidopsis thaliana, measure day length with a rhythm that is
      not reset at lights-off(3), whereas short-day plants measure night
      length on the basis of circadian rhythm of light sensitivity that is
      set from dusk(2). early flowering 3 (elf3) mutants of Arabinopsis are
      aphotoperiodic(4) and exhibit light-conditional arrhythmia(5,6). Here
      we show that the elf3-7 mutant retains oscillator function in the
      light but blunts circadian gating of CAB gene activation, indicating
      that deregulated phototransduction may mask rhythmicity. Furthermore,
      elf3 mutations confer the resetting pattern of short-day
      photoperiodism, indicating that gating of phototransduction may
      control resetting. Temperature entrainment can bypass the requirement
      for normal ELF3 function for the oscillator and partially restore
      rhythmic CAB expression. Therefore, ELF3 specifically affects light
      input to the oscillator, similar to its function in gating CAB
      activation, allowing oscillator progression past a light-sensitive
      phase in the subjective evening. ELF3 provides experimental
      demonstration of the zeitnehmer ('time-taker') Concept(7,8).

N2  - Morphine is a powerful pain reliever, but also a potent inducer of
      tolerance and dependence. The development of opiate tolerance occurs
      on continued use of the drug such that the amount of drug required to
      elicit pain relief must be increased to compensate for diminished
      responsiveness(1-3). In many systems, decreased responsiveness to
      agonists has been correlated with the desensitization of G-protein-
      coupled receptors. In vitro evidence indicates that this process
      involves phosphorylation of G-protein-coupled receptors and
      subsequent binding of regulatory proteins called beta -
      arrestins(4,5). Using a knockout mouse lacking beta -arrestin-2 (beta
      arr2(-/-)), we have assessed the contribution of desensitization of
      the mu -opioid receptor to the development of morphine
      antinociceptive tolerance and the subsequent onset of physical
      dependence. Here we show that in mice lacking beta -arrestin-2,
      desensitization of the mu -opioid receptor does not occur after
      chronic morphine treatment, and that these animals fail to develop
      antinociceptive tolerance. However, the deletion of beta -arrestin-2
      does not prevent the chronic morphine-induced upregulation of
      adenylyl cyclase activity, a cellular marker of dependence, and the
      mutant mice still become physically dependent on the drug.

N2  - gamma -Aminobutyric acid (GABA)(B) receptors couple to G(o) to
      inhibit N-type calcium channels in embryonic chick dorsal root
      ganglion neurons(1). The voltage-independent inhibition, mediated by
      means of a tyrosine-kinase pathway(2), is transient and lasts up to
      100 seconds. Inhibition of endogenous RGS12, a member of the family
      of regulators of G-protein signalling, selectively alters the time
      course of voltage-independent inhibition. The RGS12 protein, in
      addition to the RGS domain, contains PDZ and PTB domains(3). Fusion
      proteins containing the PTB domain of RGS12 alter the rate of
      termination of the GABAB signal, whereas the PDZ or RGS domains of
      RGS12 have no observable effects. Using primary dorsal root ganglion
      neurons in culture, here we show an endogenous agonist-induced
      tyrosine-kinase-dependent complex of RGS12 and the calcium channel.
      These results indicate that RGS12 is a multifunctional protein
      capable of direct interactions through its PTB domain with the
      tyrosine-phosphorylated calcium channel. Recruitment of RGS proteins
      to G-protein effecters may represent an additional mechanism for
      signal termination in G-protein-coupled pathways.

N2  - Mechanical forces between cells have a principal role in the
      organization of animal tissues. Adherens junctions are an important
      component of these tissues, connecting cells through their actin
      cytoskeleton and allowing the assembly of tensile structures(1-4). At
      least one adherens junction protein, beta -catenin, also acts as a
      signalling molecule, directly regulating gene expression(5-7). To
      date, adherens junctions have only been detected in metazoa, and
      therefore we looked for them outside the animal kingdom to examine
      their evolutionary origins. The non-metazoan Dictyostelium discoideum
      forms a multicellular, differentiated structure(8). Here we describe
      the discovery of actin-associated intercellular junctions in
      Dictyostelium. We have isolated a gene encoding a beta -catenin
      homologue, aardvark, which is a component of the junctional complex,
      and, independently, is required for cell signalling. Our discovery of
      adherens junctions outside the animal kingdom shows that the dual
      role of beta -catenin in cell-cell adhesion and cell sig-nailing
      evolved before the origins of metazoa.

N2  - Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP)(1) functions in
      several intracellular events including filopodium formation(2),
      vesicle transport(3) and movement of Shigella frexneri(4,5) and
      vaccinia virus(6), by stimulating rapid actin polymerization through
      the Arp2/3 complex. N-WASP is regulated by the direct binding of
      Cdc42 (refs 7, 8), which exposes the domain in N-WASP that activates
      the Arp2/3 complex(2,9). A WASP-related protein, WAVE/ Scar,
      functions in pac-induced membrane ruffling(10,11); however, pac does
      not bind directly to WAVE(10), raising the question of how WAVE is
      regulated by Rac. Here we demonstrate that IRSp53, a substrate for
      insulin receptor(12) with unknown function, is the 'missing link'
      between pac and WAVE. Activated Rac binds to the amino terminus of
      IRSp53, and carboxy-terminal Src-homology-3 domain of IRSp53 binds to
      WAVE to form a trimolecular complex. From studies of ectopic
      expression, we found that IRSp53 is essential for Rac to induce
      membrane ruffling, probably because it recruits WAVE, which
      stimulates actin polymerization mediated by the Arp2/3 complex.

N2  - Receptor-mediated generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
      (InsP(3)) initiates Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and the
      subsequent activation of store-operated calcium influx(1). InsP(3) is
      metabolized within seconds by 5-phosphatase and 3-kinase(2), yielding
      Ins(1,4)P-2 and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (InsP(4)),
      respectively. Some studies have suggested that InsP(4) controls Ca2+
      influx in combination with InsP(3) (refs 3 and 4), but another study
      did not find the same result(5). Some of the apparent conflicts
      between these previous studies have been resolved(6); however, the
      physiological function of InsP(4) remains elusive(7,8). Here we have
      investigated the function of InsP(4) in Ca2+ influx in the mast cell
      line RBL-2H3, and we show that InsP(4) inhibits InsP(3) metabolism
      through InsP(3) 5-phosphatase, thereby facilitating the activation of
      the store-operated Ca2+ current I-CRAC (ref. 9). Physiologically,
      this mechanism opens a discriminatory time window for coincidence
      detection that enables selective facilitation of Ca2+ influx by
      appropriately timed low-level receptor stimulation. At higher
      concentrations, InsP(4) acts as an inhibitor of InsP(3) receptors,
      enabling InsP(4) to act as a potent bi-modal regulator of cellular
      sensitivity to InsP(3), which provides both facilitatory and
      inhibitory feedback on Ca2+ signalling.

N2  - DNA from bacteria has stimulatory effects on mammalian immune cells(1-
      3) which depend on the presence of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in
      the bacterial DNA. In contrast, mammalian DNA has a low frequency of
      CpG dinucleotides, and these are mostly methylated; therefore,
      mammalian DNA does not have immune-stimulatory activity. CpG DNA
      induces a strong T-helper-1-like inflammatory response(4-7).
      Accumulating evidence has revealed the therapeutic potential of CpG
      DNA as adjuvants for vaccination strategies for cancer, allergy and
      infectious diseasess(8-10). Despite its promising clinical use, the
      molecular mechanism by which CpG DNA activates immune cells remains
      unclear. Here we show that cellular response to CpG DNA is mediated
      by a Toll-like receptor, TLR9. TLR9-deficient (TLR9(-/-)) mice did
      not show any response to CpG DNA, including proliferation of
      splenocytes, inflammatory Cytokine production from macrophages and
      maturation of dendritic cells. TLR9(-/-) mice showed resistance to
      the lethal effect of CPG DNA without any elevation of serum pro-
      inflammatory cytokine levels. The in vivo CpG-DNA-mediated T-helper
      type-1 response was also abolished in TLR9(-/-) mice. Thus,
      vertebrate immune systems appear to have evolved a specific Toll-like
      receptor that distinguishes bacterial DNA from self-DNA.

N2  - Motors generating mechanical force, powered by the hydrolysis of ATP,
      translocate double-stranded DNA into preformed capsids (proheads) of

      Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage phi 29 into a precursor capsid. We

      ATPase complex acting as a stator, the DNA acting as a spindle, and
      the connector as a ball-race. The helical nature of the DNA converts
      the rotary action of the connector into translation of the DNA.
