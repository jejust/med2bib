AU  - Wortel,M.J.R.
AU  - Spakman,W.
U1  - Review
SP  - 1910
EP  - 1917
N2  - Seismic tomography models of the three-dimensional upper mantle
      velocity structure of the Mediterranean-Carpathian region provide a
      better understanding of the lithospheric processes governing its
      geodynamical evolution. Slab detachment, in particular lateral
      migration of this process along the plate boundary, is a key element
      in the lithospheric dynamics of the region during the last 20 to 30
      million years. It strongly affects arc and trench migration, and
      causes along-strike variations in vertical motions, stress fields,
      and magmatism. In a terminal-stage subduction zone, involving
      collision and suturing, slab detachment is the natural last stage in
      the gravitational settling of subducted lithosphere.

U1  - Article
SP  - 1927
EP  - 1937
N2  - Layered and massive outcrops on Mars, some as thick as 4 kilometers,
      display the geomorphic attributes and stratigraphic relations of
      sedimentary rock. Repeated beds in some locations imply a dynamic
      depositional environment during early martian history. Subaerial
      (such as eolian, impact, and volcaniclastic) and subaqueous processes
      may have contributed to the formation of the layers. Affinity for
      impact craters suggests dominance of lacustrine deposition;
      alternatively, the materials were deposited in a dry, subaerial
      setting in which atmospheric density, and variations thereof mimic a
      subaqueous depositional environment. The source regions and transport
      paths for the materials are not preserved.

AU  - Exner,K.
AU  - Schleyer,P.V.
U1  - Article
SP  - 1937
EP  - 1940
N2  - The viability of molecules with planar hexacoordinate carbon atoms is
      demonstrated by density-functional theory (DFT) calculations for CB62-
      , a CB6H2 isomer, and three C3B4 minima. All of these species have
      six pi electrons and are aromatic. Although other C3B4 isomers are
      lower in energy, the activation barriers for the rearrangements of
      the three planar carbon C3B4 minima into more stable isomers are
      appreciable, and experimental observation should be possible. High-
      Level ab initio calculations confirm the DFT results. The planar
      hexacoordination in these species does not violate the octet rule
      because six partial bonds to the central carbons are involved.

AU  - Forte,A.M.
AU  - Perry,H.K.C.
U1  - Article
SP  - 1940
EP  - 1944
N2  - The tectosphere, namely the portions of Earth's mantle Lying below
      cratons, has a thermochemical structure that differs from average
      suboceanic mantle. The tectosphere is thought to be depleted in its
      basaltic components and to have an intrinsic buoyancy that balances
      the mass increase associated with its colder temperature relative to
      suboceanic mantle. Inversions of a large set of geodynamic data
      related to mantle convection, using tomography-based mantle flow
      models, indicate that the tectosphere is chemically depleted and
      relatively cold to 250 kilometers depth below Earth's surface. The
      approximate equilibrium between thermal and chemical buoyancy
      contributes to cratonic stability over geological time.

AU  - Zhang,K.K.

U1  - Article
SP  - 1944
EP  - 1947
N2  - We report the discovery of a convective phenomenon found to occur in
      a rotating spherical system in which an inner convectively unstable
      fluid layer is bounded by a corotating outer convectively stable
      fluid layer. Although convection is thermally driven in the unstable
      interior, the resulting convective motions concentrate primarily in
      the stable outer region. This phenomenon, which we term
      teleconvection, suggests that fluid motions observed at the "surface"
      of a planet (such as Jupiter's alternating zonal winds) may be driven
      by an energy source located deep inside the planet.

AU  - Rohl,U.
U1  - Article
SP  - 1947
EP  - 1951
N2  - Sedimentary time series of color reflectance and major element
      chemistry from the anoxic Cariaco Basin off the coast of northern
      Venezuela record large and abrupt shifts in the hydrologic cycle of
      the tropical Atlantic during the past 90,000 years. Marine
      productivity maxima and increased precipitation and riverine
      discharge from northern South America are closely linked to
      interstadial (warm) climate events of marine isotope stage 3, as
      recorded in Greenland ice cores. Increased precipitation at this
      latitude during interstadials suggests the potential for greater
      moisture export from the Atlantic to Pacific, which could have
      affected the salinity balance of the Atlantic and increased
      thermohaline heat transport to high northern latitudes. This supports
      the notion that tropical feedbacks played an important role in
      modulating global climate during the last glacial period.

U1  - Article
SP  - 1951
EP  - 1954
N2  - Radiocarbon data from the Cariaco Basin provide calibration of the
      carbon-14 time scale across the period of deglaciation (15,000 to
      10,000 years ago) with resolution available previously only from
      Holocene tree rings. Reconstructed changes in atmospheric carbon-14
      are larger than previously thought, with the largest change occurring
      simultaneously with the sudden climatic cooling of the Younger Dryas
      event. Carbon-14 and published beryllium-10 data together suggest
      that concurrent climate and carbon-14 changes were predominantly the
      result of abrupt shifts in deep ocean ventilation.

U1  - Article
SP  - 1955
EP  - 1959
N2  - A fossil enantiornithine bird, Protopteryx fengningensis gen. et sp.
      nov., was collected from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of
      Northern China. it provides fossil evidence of a triosseal canal in
      early birds. The manus and the alular digit are long, as in
      Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis, but are relatively short in other
      enantiornithines. The alula or bastard wing is attached to an
      unreduced alular digit. The two central tail feathers are scalelike
      without branching. This type of feather may suggest that modern
      feathers evolved through the following stages: (i) elongated scale,
      (ii) central shaft, (iii) barbs, and finally (iv) barbules and
      barbicel.

N2  - Genetic engineering of non-beta cells to release insulin upon feeding
      could be a therapeutic modality for patients with diabetes. A tumor-
      derived K-cell line was induced to produce human insulin by providing
      the cells with the human insulin gene linked tb the 5'-regulatory
      region of the gene encoding glucose-dependent insulinotropic
      polypeptide (GIP). Mice expressing this transgene produced human
      insulin specifically in gut K cells. This insulin protected the mice
      from developing diabetes and maintained glucose tolerance after
      destruction of the native insulin-producing beta cells.

N2  - Genetic disorders affecting cellular responses to DNA damage are
      characterized by high rates of translocations involving antigen
      receptor loci and increased susceptibility to lymphoid malignancies.
      We report that the Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein (NBS1) and
      histone gamma -H2AX, which associate with irradiation-induced DNA
      double-strand breaks (DSBs), are also found at sites of V(D)J
      (variable, diversity, joining) recombination-induced DSBs. In
      developing thymocytes, NBS1 and gamma -H2AX form nuclear foci that
      colocalize with the T cell receptor alpha locus in response to
      recombination activating gene (RAG) protein-mediated V(D)J cleavage.
      Our results suggest that surveillance of T cell receptor
      recombination intermediates by NBS1 and gamma -H2AX may be important
      for preventing oncogenic translocations.

N2  - Tissue manipulation experiments in amphibians more than 50 years ago
      showed that induction of the inner ear requires two signals: a
      mesodermal signal followed by a neural signal. However, the molecules
      mediating this process have remained elusive. We present evidence for
      mesodermal initiation of otic development in higher Vertebrates and
      show that the mesoderm can direct terminal differentiation of the
      inner ear in rostral ectoderm. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
      synergistic interactions of the extracellular polypeptide ligands FGF-
      19 and Wnt-8c as mediators of mesodermal and neural signals,
      respectively, initiating inner ear development.

N2  - Feedforward models of visual cortex appear to be inconsistent with a
      well-known property of cortical cells: contrast invariance of
      orientation tuning. The models' fixed threshold broadens orientation
      tuning as contrast increases, whereas in real cells tuning width is
      invariant with contrast. We have compared the orientation tuning of
      spike and membrane potential responses in single cells. Both are
      contrast invariant, yet a threshold-linear relation applied to the
      membrane potential accurately predicts the orientation tuning of
      spike responses. The key to this apparent paradox lies in the
      noisiness of the membrane potential. Responses that are subthreshold
      on average are still capable of generating spikes on individual
      trials. Unlike the iceberg effect, contrast invariance remains intact
      even as threshold narrows orientation selectivity. Noise may, by
      extension, smooth the average relation between membrane potential and
      spike rate throughout the brain.

N2  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health problem
      affecting an estimated 170 million individuals worldwide. We report
      the identification of multiple independent adaptive mutations that
      cluster in the HCV nonstructural protein NS5A and confer increased
      replicative ability in vitro. Among these adaptive mutations were a
      single amino acid substitution that allowed HCV RNA replication in
      10% of transfected hepatoma cells and a deletion of 47 amino acids
      encompassing the interferon (IFN) sensitivity determining region
      (ISDR). Independent of the ISDR, IFN-alpha rapidly inhibited HCV RNA
      replication in vitro. This work establishes a robust, cell-based
      system for genetic and functional analyses of HCV replication.

N2  - Diploid yeast cells repeatedly polarize and bud from their poles,
      probably because of highly stable marks of unknown composition. Here,
      Rax2, a membrane protein, was shown to behave as such a mark. The
      Rax2 protein itself was inherited immutably at the cell cortex for
      multiple generations, and Rax2 was shown to have a half-life
      exceeding several generations. The persistent inheritance of cortical
      protein markers would provide a means to couple a cell's history to
      the future development of a precise morphogenetic form.

N2  - Rhodopsin is essential for photoreceptor morphogenesis;
      photoreceptors lacking rhodopsin degenerate in humans, mice, and
      Drosophila. Here we report that transgenic expression of a dominant-
      active Drosophila Rho guanosine triphosphatase, Drac1, rescued
      photoreceptor morphogenesis in rhodopsin-null mutants; expression of
      dominant-negative Drac1 resulted in a phenotype similar to that seen
      in rhodopsin-null mutants. Drac1 was localized in a specialization of
      the photoreceptor cortical actin cytoskeleton, which was lost in
      rhodopsin-null mutants. Thus, rhodopsin appears to organize the actin
      cytoskeleton through Drac1, contributing a structural support-
      essential for photoreceptor morphogenesis.
